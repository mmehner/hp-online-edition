Homage to the glorious Ādinātha who taught the science of Haṭhayoga which is like a splendid stairway for one who wants to climb to the lofty royal terrace.%JM: would much prefer "science" to "system" (vidyā doesn't mean system). I changed "ladder" to "stairway" (a bit more poetic). I'd also prefer "which is like a splendid stairway for one who wants to climb to the lofty royal terrace."
%JB: I much prefer Jim's alternative translation (i.e.~"which is like...). But I think we should avoid translating vidyā as `science' because it implies that there was some antecedent to the scientific method in premodern yoga traditions. Also, in light of the current politics around yoga in India, "science of Haṭha" fosters the rather absurd view that ancient Indian knowledge systems anticipated scientific discoveries of the 20th century.  JM: But "system" is wrong. JB: doctrine is better than science.

In his commentary on \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 1.1 Brahmānanda first states that the author Svātmārāma starts appropriately with a \emph{maṅgala}, a verse of adoration addressing Ādinātha, i.e.\ Śiva, but in accordance with his non-sectarian approach leaves room for a second interpretation of the word as Viṣṇu. A sentence later this is contradicted by his explanantion that Ādinātha, who first taught Yoga, taught it to Pārvatī, which limits the scope to Śiva. \lb

%add comment about yoga replacing mārga and saudha here and in the next two verses.
The reading \emph{rājasaudham} in the third verse quarter is well attested by the manuscripts, including \alphaOne. However, the most common reading in manuscripts on the lower branches of the stemma is \emph{rājayogam}, which was accepted by Brahmānanda in \emph{Jyotsnā} 1.1 (see below). It appears that some scribes have made a concerted effort to replace words like \emph{saudha}, \emph{vidyā} and \emph{mārga} with \emph{yoga} in the opening verses of the text (see also 1.2d and 1.3b), even at the expense of the poetic imagery. \lb

In light of the variants, which have led to our critical edition, Brahmānanda's choices and interpretation of the second half cannot be upheld. This is Brahmānanda's version and the relevant portion of his commentary:

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{śrīādināthāya namo'stu tasmai\\+} 
\tl{yenopadiṣṭā haṭhayogavidyā/\\+}
\tl{vibhrājate pronnatarājayogam\\+} 
\tl{āroḍhum icchor adhirohiṇīva// \texteng{\footnotesize 1.1}//\\!}
\end{versinnote}

Our choice of \emph{virājate} in the third verse quarter reflects the relevant manuscripts and rhymes with the following \emph{rāja-}. The difference in meaning is negligable.\lb

The main problem in Brahmānanda's interpretation is his choice of \emph{-rājayogaṃ} over \emph{-rāja\-sau\-dhaṃ}, which he explains as follows:

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{rājayogaś ca sarvavṛttinirodhalakṣaṇo'samprajñātayogaḥ. tam icchor mumukṣor adhirohiṇīva adhi\-ruhyate'nayety adhi\skx{-}{}rohiṇī niḥśreṇīva vibhrājate viśeṣeṇa bhrājate śobhate. yathā pronnatasaudham āroḍhum icchor adhirohiṇy anāyāsena saudha\-prāpi\-kā bhavati evaṃ haṭhapradīpikāpi pronnatarājayogam āroḍhum icchor anā\-yāsena rājayogaprāpikā bhavatīti upamālaṅkāraḥ.  indravajrākhyaṃ vṛttam.\\!}

Rājayoga is the yoga without cognition (\emph{asaṃprajñāta}) defined [by Patañjali] as the stopping of all movements of the mind. To a liberation seeker desiring this, [the science of Haṭhayoga] shines like a ladder. Just as a ladder leads someone desiring to ascend to a lofty terrace easily to the terrace, in the same way also the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} leads someone desiring the lofty Rājayoga easily to Rājayoga. [In this verse] the trope is a comparison. The metre is Indravajrā.

% Rājayoga is the yoga without cognition,\footnote{This must refer to the \emph{asaṃprajñātasamādhi} of the \emph{Yogasūtra} via the equation \emph{yogaḥ samādhiḥ} in the \emph{Bhāṣya} on \emph{Yogasūtra}  1.1. condense to "i.e.~the \emph{asaṃprajnātasmādhi} of the \emph{Pātañjalayogaśāstra}.} defined as the stopping of all movements of the mind. To a liberation seeker desiring this, [the science of Haṭhayoga] shines like a ladder.\footnote{The commentary adds etymological explanations: ``\emph{adhirohiṇī} means that by which one ascends, i.e.\ a ladder'', and a synonym for ``shines'', which are not translated here.} Just as a ladder leads someone desiring to ascend to a lofty terrace easily to the terrace, in the same way also the \emph{haṭhapradīpikā} leads someone desiring the lofty Rājayoga easily to Rājayoga. [In this verse] the trope is a comparison. The metre is Indravajrā.
\end{quote}

The interpretation makes good sense: Haṭhayoga leads effortlessly to Rājayoga, just as a ladder leads one to a high terrace. And the comparison as outlined by Brahmānanda has all the elements deemed necessary by Sanskritic poetology:

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=4pt,labelsep=0.5em]
\item Particle expressing a comparison (\emph{upamāvācaka}): \emph{iva} 
\item Standard of comparison (\emph{upamāna}): ladder leading to the terrace (\emph{saudhaprāpikā adhirohiṇī}) 
\item Thing that is compared (\emph{upameya}): \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}
that leads to Rājayoga (\emph{rājayoga\-prāpikā haṭhapradīpikā}) 
\item Common quality  (\emph{samānadharma}): Effortlessness (\emph{anāyāsena})
\end{enumerate}

According to classical poetology a comparison containing all four elements is termed a ``full comparison'' (\emph{pūrṇopamā}), whereas an elision of one or more elements is called a ``deficient comparison'' (\emph{luptopamā}). One element that cannot be omitted without losing the comparison is the \emph{upamāna}. In the verse as given by Brahmānanda this would be ``the ladder''. The implication is spelt out by Brahmānanda in his commmentary: ``Just as a ladder leads someone desiring to ascend to a lofty terrace easily to the terrace, in the same way also the \emph{haṭhapradīpikā} leads someone desiring the lofty Rājayoga easily to Rājayoga.'' However, his text version spells out only the side of the \emph{upameya}, that is, ``Haṭhayoga leads to Rājayoga'', but leaves the \emph{upamāna} open to interpretation. His mention of the word \emph{saudha} in the commentary suggests that this was one of the other options he found in manuscripts—this reading is very well attested—but was rejected by him. In this way Brahmānanda makes sure that the text states the obvious, but at the same time it loses part of the comparison, and it loses its dynamics, which is brought out in the reading \emph{rājasaudha} preferred with good manuscript evidence in our critical edition. We think that Brahmānanda was eager to state at the outset the primacy of Rājayoga, and to this end sacrificed the more poetically elegant original reading that mentions the royal mansion as a metaphor for the ``royal yoga''.

In comparing the science of Haṭhayoga to a stairway, Svātmārāma was perhaps consciously emulating his favourite source text, the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}, which opens with \emph{etad vimuktisopānam}, “this is the stairway to complete liberation”. 

% JM: now saudha is preferred for stemmatic reasons too. I suggest the following shortened form of the note: 
% JB: I prefer the longer note for the digital edition and the shorter one (proposed by Jim) for the printed edition. How many readers will have access to Hanneder 2020 and read the whole article? The longer note nicely summarises a longer discussion in the article.
%The \textalpha\ witnesses read \emph{virājate pronnatarājayogam} while several others have either \emph{vibhrājate} or \emph{°rājasaudham} or both. As explained in Hanneder 2020, \emph{virājate} is stylistically preferable and the comparison between the science of \emph{haṭhayoga} and a stairway works only with \emph{°rājasaudham}.

%The reading \emph{rājasaudha} is preferable for poetical reasons, as explained in Hanneder 2020, p. 128–130. Also, the \emph{Jyotsnā} explains that the \emph{alaṃkāra} here is a comparison (\emph{upamā}), which consists of four elements: (1) a particle expressing the comparison JM: what's happened here? ALso, do we need to repeat what Jürgen has already written elsewhere?
%The Sanskrit poeticians explain that when some elements of a comparison remains unexpressed we get an incomplete (\emph{lupta}) comparison. Often words like \emph{iva} or \emph{yathā} are missing or the common property, but if we read \emph{rājayoga} we lose the \emph{upamāna} (i.e.~\emph{rājasaudha}). One part of the comparison should not be missing. But from the perspective of \emph{alaṃkāraśāstra} the verse has a problem that has surely caused the dilemma: it either leaves the \emph{upameya} or the \emph{upamāna} incomplete. Brahmānanda has mentioned both ? \emph{yathā adhirohiṇī saudhaprāpikā bhavati evaṃ haṭhadīpikā rājayogaprāpikā bhavati}, but had to supply \emph{rājasaudha} because his text reads \emph{rājayoga}. But to have the \emph{upameya} in the text is odd. Even Brahmānanda could only know of the image (\emph{rājasaudha}) from the alternative reading he did not accept. However, it seems likely that the author would have included the \emph{upamāna} in the text, as in our critical text, so that the reader would know that the upper terrace of the palace is an image for \emph{rājayoga}. It is further likely that the substitution of \emph{rājayoga} for \emph{rājasaudha} was the result of the tendency to insert the word \emph{yoga} in the opening verses of the text wherever possible, even where it does not fit, as can be seen in 1.2d (\emph{haṭhayogopadiśyate}) and 1.3b (\emph{rājayogam ajānatām}). In the latter case the poetical image has also been lost.

%The metre of 1.1 is Indravajrā.

% JB Oct 11: It might be helpful to translate Brahmānanda's comment for the non-Sanskrit reader: yathā pronnatasaudham āroḍhum icchor adhirohiṇy anāyāsena saudhaprāpikā bhavati evaṃ haṭhadīpikāpi pronnatarājayogam āroḍhum icchor anāyāsena rājayogaprāpikā bhavatīti upamālaṅkāraḥ
% JB: ``Just like one, who wishes to climb a lofty terrace, reaches the terrace without effort by a staircase, in the same way, one, who wishes to climb the lofty royal Yoga, reaches the royal Yoga by means of the Haṭhapradīpikā. This is the (poetic figure called) \emph{comparison}."

% JB: [...] but had to supply \emph{rājasaudha} because his text reads \emph{rājayoga}.
% JB: Even Brahmānanda could only know of the image of the upper terrace of the palace (\emph{rājasaudha})

Most witnesses (including \alphaTwo) have \emph{rājayogam ajānatām} (`for those ignorant of Rājayoga') in 1.3b. The reading \emph{rājamārgam ajānatām} (\alphaOne\ and \alphaThree), “for those unable to find the royal highway”, is more appropriate to the metaphor of being lost in darkness. \lb

%In 1.3d \emph{kṛpākaraḥ} is attested by the most important groups, including \textalpha, of the available manuscripts. The readings \emph{prakāśyate} and \emph{kṣamākaraḥ} are attested by some manuscripts in lower branches of the stemma. Since the context is the author helping yogis who have strayed from the royal path, \emph{kṛpākaraḥ} makes good sense. 

As Brahmānanda notes, the compound \emph{kṛpākaraḥ} can be understood as one who is compassionate (\emph{kṛpā} + \emph{kara}) or one who is a mine (i.e.~a rich source) of compassion (\emph{kṛpā} + \emph{ākara}). In the Devanāgarī transmission, the \emph{kṣa} of \emph{kṣamākaraḥ} probably arose as a mistake for \emph{kṛ}.

The variant \emph{mahāyogī} in \zetaOne\ and other manuscripts (\getsiglum{G5,J4,J11,Ko}) is probably an attempt to remove the difficulty of understanding \emph{athavā}.

This is also the case in some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} (P,T,t1 in Gharote 2009: 35 n.\,8). \lb

The names Nāgabodha, Nāgabodhi, Nāradeva, Nāgadeva all seem possible in 1.8c. The reading \emph{nāgabodhaś ca} is attested across several primary groups of manuscripts. \lb

The \alphaOne\ and \alphaTwo\ reading of \emph{siddhaḥ kāpālikas} is an exception among the manuscripts and seems too vague to be referring to someone within a lineage. Khaṇḍa\-kāpālika is well attested by the remaining manuscripts (including \alphaThree) and this name appears in other texts, e.g.~Vajrapāṇi’s \emph{Laghutantraṭīkā}, p.\,45, where Khaṇḍakāpālika is the first of the 24 Vīras (\emph{vīrāḥ khaṇḍakāpālikādayaś caturviṃśatiḥ}). It is likely to refer to an ascetic who carries a broken skull. \emph{Matsyendrasaṃhitā} 33.2 mentions a practice for which one needs a \emph{khaṇḍakapāla} and in the \emph{Saṃvaramaṇḍala} of the \emph{Niṣpannayogāvalī}, p.26, Vajravārāhī is \emph{kapālakhaṇḍakṛtakaṭibhūṣaṇā}. The compound \emph{khaṇḍakāpālika} is found at \emph{Kathāsaritsāgara} 18.2.6, but there \sl{khaṇḍa} is being used in a derogatory sense (18.2.15 refers to the same character as a \sl{duṣṭakāpālika}).
%It may be a derogatory name for a Kāpālika, coined perhaps by an outsider and connoting something like a defective Kāpālika in the sense of a ‘part-time’ Kāpālika. Alternatively, it could simply refer to one who uses a broken skull as a bowl. 
% Reference to the KSS completed and text changed: before: Examples include \emph{Kathāsaritsāgara} 121.5 ff. (check).  Why "part-time".

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_012]  
The term \emph{maṭhikā} occurs in narrative literature and yoga texts in the sense of a small hut. For example, in the \textit{Kathāsaritsāgara} (12.9.14, 29–30), \emph{maṭhikā} refers to the small hut built in a cremation ground by a young Brahmin who makes as his bed the ashes of the dead girl he had hoped to marry. In several other stories (\textit{Kathāsaritsāgara} 6.6.132, 10.5.89, 12.25.35), \emph{maṭhikā} is the term used for the hut of an ascetic. In an elaborate description of the huts (\emph{maṭhikā}) used for Haṭhayoga, the author of the \emph{Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati} states that the dimensions of the hut are four ``\emph{hasta}s" high and wide (there are various definitions of the term: 18 inches according to the Larger Petrograd Dictionary and Monier-Williams, 48 inches according to the Smaller Petrograd Dictionary; the NWS lists even more variations, but the stipulation that the hut is the length of a bow found in the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (on which see below) suggests that 18 inches was meant). The hut can be made of various materials, such as red earth, ashes, plaster and so on (Birch and Singleton 2019: 17–18).\lb

In the \emph{Jyotsnā} and printed editions of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, including one by Digambara and Kokaje (1970: 6), this verse has the additional line, \emph{dhanuḥ\-pramāṇa\-paryantaṃ śilāgnijalavarjite}. This line derives from the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (32cd), which has \emph{paryante} instead of \emph{paryantaṃ}. It stipulates that the hut should be built in a place measuring up to a bow length and free from rocks, fire and water. None of the early manuscripts has this line, which suggests that it was added at a later time. Nonetheless, it appears in over a dozen manuscripts that were consulted for this edition. These manuscripts are not close to an early hyp\-archetype of the text.

The syntax of this verse is problematic. One would expect the features of the hut, which are listed in the first three quarters of the verse, to be in the nominative case. Then, the words \emph{idaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ} in the fourth quarter would refer back to them. However, the compounds in the first three verse-quarters appear to qualify \emph{lakṣaṇa} as though they were adjectives, and this seems to have been the way the verse was composed. \lb    

The manuscripts preserve many different readings at the end of the compound beginning with \emph{arandhragarta}. We have adopted \emph{piṭaka}, which usually means ``a basket'' but can also mean ``a boil or blister," because it is well attested and might here refer to bumps on the floors or walls that would make them uneven. Another possibility is \emph{piṭharaṃ}, which can have the sense of potsherds and would here mean that the hut should be free of rubbish on the floor. One would expect a word for a defect in a hut that is similar to, but not the same as, cracks (\emph{randhra}) and holes (\emph{garta}). For this reason, the reading \emph{vivaraṃ} looks like a patch, as its meaning does not add anything to \emph{randhragarta}. The reading \emph{viṭapaṃ} (`the young branch of a tree or creeper') attested in some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} is difficult to construe in this context unless it was intended to refer to creepers or branches that might invade or encroach upon the hut.\lb

% (MD: Stemmatically, \emph{piṭaka} ``a basket; a boil" is well attested. Is it perhaps possible to interpret the word as ``a bump"? \emph{a-randhra-garta-piṭaka} would then mean that the floor or walls of the hut are not uneven.) JM: yes, sounds good to me.
%JB Okay I've written the note to reflect this. 
% MD 2024-8: amalaṃ or vimalaṃ? amalaṃ best

Manuscripts of several groups, namely \textepsilon, \texteta, and \textpi, have \emph{bādhojjitaṃ}, whereas \textgamma, \textdelta\ and the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} have the more easily understood reading of \emph{jantūjjhitaṃ} (‘free from creatures’). The \textalpha\ group is split on this, with \alphaThree\ (\emph{bodhojhitaṃ}) closer to \emph{bādhojjhitaṃ} and \alphaOne\ (\emph{jyaṃtyūpsitaṃ}) and \alphaTwo\ (\emph{jaṃtūṣṇitaṃ}) closer to \emph{jantūjjhitaṃ}. We have adopted the more unusual reading of \emph{bādhojjhitaṃ} with the support of a similar description of a hut in \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} 6.17.67 (\emph{gṛhe nirābādhe}).

Since many scribes do not use an \emph{avagraha}, we cannot be sure whether to understand \emph{niyamagrahaḥ} in \emph{pāda} b as having a negative prefix. Although \emph{yama} and \emph{niyama} are not included in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} as auxiliaries of Haṭhayoga, verse 2.14 implies that some \emph{niyama}s are necessary at least in the early stages of establishing a practice. Furthermore, verse 3.78 suggests that a yogi who does not practice \emph{niyama} might obtain success in yoga through the practice of \textit{vajrolī}. Thirty of the manuscripts consulted for this critical edition contain additional verses on ten \emph{yama} and ten \emph{niyama}, which are usually inserted after 1.16 and derive from either the \emph{Śāradātilakatantra} (25.7–8) or the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā} (1.38, 1.53). %JB 2.14 doesnt mention niyama (and more correctly only implies mitāhāra). Perhaps we should rephrase this as, "...2.14 implies that some rules (niyama) were necessary at least..."
%In the \emph{Jyotsnā}, Brahmānanda reads \emph{niyamāgraha} and takes it as though \emph{āgraha} was implied, which yields the meaning of ‘over-insistence on rules’, and he relates it to extreme ascetic practice.

\textalpha\ and several other groups of manuscripts have \emph{tattvajñānārthadarśanāt} (as found in \emph{Bhagavadgītā} 13.11), \emph{tattvajñānāc ca darśanāt} or something very similar in the second \emph{pāda} of the verse, but \emph{darśanāt} (\alphaOne) by itself is problematic: a vision of what? The early sources of this verse, in particular the \emph{Śivadharmottara}, indicate that the second verse quarter read as \emph{santoṣāt tattvadarśanāt}, which makes much better sense of the word \emph{darśanāt} so we have adopted that reading. \lb
%However it seems likely that before the time of Svātmārāma other versions of this verse were circulating in which \emph{santoṣāt} was not found, \emph{niścayāt} had moved from the first to second verse quarter, \emph{tattvadarśanāt} had become \emph{tattvajñānāt} and \emph{sāhasāt} was introduced. 

It should also be noted that the word \emph{tattva} could have a more specific meaning in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} (4.32–33) as Svātmā\-rāma states that it is a synonym of \emph{samādhi}. In other yoga texts, it can sometimes refer to the practices of yoga (e.g. \emph{tritattva} in \emph{Amṛtasiddhi} 13.12, 14.2--3) or, more generally, to the highest reality or truth (e.g. \emph{Amanaska} 1.2, 1.20–21, 2.17 etc.).  
\end{philcomm}
%</cm16>

% MD 2024-8: Are we really remaining with the reading sāhasād of gamma/delta? The compound tattvajñānārthadarśana occurs in Bhagavadgītā 13.11. Does it not work either? In BhG it is a single thing and we need two.

The reading \emph{aṅgapāṭavam} is attested among many of the early manuscripts, including the \textalpha\ group. Although this compound rarely appears in other yoga texts, a similar term, \emph{śarīrapāṭava}, occurs in the \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} (2.35) as one of the benefits bestowed by digestive fire (\emph{vaiśvānarāgni}), which indicates that the word \emph{pāṭava} was used in relation to the body and the benefits of yoga. The compound \emph{aṅgapāṭava} seems to imply the optimal functioning of the body. The variant reading, \emph{aṅgalāghava} (‘lightness of the limbs’ or ‘dexterity’) is more common in yoga texts and similar formulations occur even in works known to Svātmārāma, such as the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} (\emph{śarīralaghutā}) and the \textit{Amanaska} ([...] \emph{laghutvaṃ ca śarīrasyopajāyate}). It appears that the less common term \emph{aṅgapāṭavam} was changed to the more widely used notion of \emph{aṅgalāghava}, perhaps early in the transmission, as the latter is attested by manuscripts in several early groups (i.e.~\textgamma, \textdelta, and \textpi).

One might wonder how the soles of the feet could be placed between the knees and thighs. Brahmānanda explains that the region of the shank near the knee should be understood by the word ‘knee’ in this verse (\emph{atra jānuśabdena jānusaṃnihito jaṅghāpradeśo grāhyaḥ jānusaṃnihito jaṅghāpradeśaḥ}). This is consistent with the earliest known description of \emph{svastikāsana}, found in the \emph{Pātañjala\-yoga\-śāstra\-vivaraṇa} (2.46), which states that the big toe of one foot is tucked in between the shank and thigh of the other so it is not seen (\emph{dakṣiṇaṃ pādāṅguṣṭhaṃ savyenorujaṅghena parigṛhyādṛśyaṃ kṛtvā tathā savyaṃ pādāṅguṣṭhaṃ dakṣiṇenorujaṅghenādṛśyaṃ parigṛhya yathā ca pārṣṇibhyāṃ vṛṣaṇayor apīḍaṇaṃ tathā yenāste tat svastikam āsanam}). For a discussion of \emph{svastikāsana} in the Pātañjalayoga tradition, see Maas 2018: 68–69. The descriptions of \emph{svastikāsana} in early Śaiva Tantras do not mention the inserting of the toes between the knees and thighs (see Goodall 2004: 348–350, fn. 371).

Although most witnesses have \emph{tathā} in 1.21a, the word \emph{atha} has been accepted because it is attested by \alphaThree\ and \etaOne, the sources and the testimonia. It appears to be verse filler here rather than indicating a temporal sequence of actions. Svātmārāma borrowed the verse on \emph{vīrāsana} from the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}, the redactor of which appears to have adapted its first line from a description of this posture in the \emph{Śāradātilakatantra}. This would explain the rather strange syntax of the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}’s version, in which \emph{adhaḥ kṛtvā} was changed to \emph{athaikasmin}, and \emph{tathetaram} became \emph{ca saṃsthitam}. It seems that \emph{saṃsthitaṃ} must be understood with \emph{ūruṃ} in the third \emph{pāda} in the sense of \emph{saṃsthāpya} (i.e.~‘having placed’).\lb

Different versions of \emph{vīrāsana} are found in earlier tantric and yogic works, such as the \emph{Kiraṇatantra}, Hemacandra’s \emph{Yogaśāstra} and commentaries on the \emph{Pātañjalayogaśāstra}. For a discussion of some of these, see Maas 2018: 66–68.

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_022]   
In the first quarter of the verse, the witnesses are split between \emph{nirudhya} (‘having blocked’), \emph{nibadhya} (‘having bound’), \emph{niyamya} (‘having restrained’) and \emph{niṣpīḍya} (‘having pressed’). The source, the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}, and two manuscripts of the \textgamma\ and \textpi\ groups support \emph{nirudhya} whereas \alphaTwo\ and the testimonia support \emph{niyamya} and \alphaThree\ has \emph{niṣpīḍya}. While \emph{nirudhya} makes sense here (i.e.~`having blocked or closed the anus...'), we have adopted \emph{niṣpīḍya} because it is better attested among the \textalpha, \textepsilon\ and \texteta\ groups.\lb

The word \emph{vyutkrameṇa} describes the position of the ankles. Its basic meaning is ‘against the normal direction.’ In \emph{āsana} descriptions it usually means ‘crossed’ (see e.g.~\emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā} 1.71), which is how we have understood it here. It could also mean ‘turned out’: if the yogi is in a kneeling-type position, turning the feet out would bring the ankles together, blocking the perineal area. See \emph{Yoga Mīmāṃsā}, vol. 8, no. 2 (1965: 29–30) for a discussion of \emph{vyutkrameṇa} and the position of the ankles in \emph{kūrmāsana}, and vol. 8, no. 2, figures 3–6 for photographs of a practitioner performing this \emph{āsana}.

We have adopted the reading \emph{dhanurākarṣaṇaṃ kṛtvā}, which is in the \textdelta\ group, as well as the principal testimonia (i.e.~the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} and \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī}), because it fits the overall syntax of the verse, unlike the readings with \emph{kṛṣṭaṃ} (for \emph{kṛtvā}) that are found in the early manuscripts. It is curious that \emph{kṛṣṭaṃ} is so well attested because it seems redundant with \emph{ākarṣaṇaṃ}. The following reading in Godāvaramiśra's \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} (f. 40r) appears to be an attempt to make sense of \emph{kṛṣṭaṃ}: \emph{dhanurākarṣavat kṛṣṭaṃ dhanurāsanam ucyate}.\lb
% MD: The well attested reading is dhanurākarṣaṇākṛṣṭaṃ as one word. The commentary should be slightly modified.

A different version of \emph{dhanurāsana} is described in the \emph{Haṭhayogasaṃhitā}. On the two versions of \emph{dhanurāsana}, see Hargreaves and Birch 2017.\lb
%https://www.theluminescent.org/2017/11/dhanurasana-two-versions-of-bow-pose.html

One manuscript of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} (ms.~no.~30051, f.\,2v), which was consulted but not collated for this edition, has a scribal comment stating that \emph{dhanurāsana} should be done continuously (\emph{anavarata}) on the left and right sides (\emph{tatra ekam dhanurākarṣaṇāsanam āsanaṃ savyāpasavyapādahastābhyām [abhy]ased anavaratam}).

In the second verse quarter, most of the manuscript groups have a compound with \emph{doṣṇā} at the end, as seen also in the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi}, \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} and \emph{Yuktabhavadeva}. The instrumental ending (`with the hand') works well with the gerund (\emph{pragṛhya}) in the third verse quarter and the object (\emph{dakṣpādaṃ}) in the first quarter. This reading indicates that the right foot is held by the hand of the arm that is wrapped around the outside of the left leg, which would be the right hand (\emph{dakṣadoṣṇā}) rather than the left (\emph{vāmadoṣṇā}), as shown in \medialink{Figure 1}{matsyendrasana1.jpeg}.\lb

\alphaThree\ and most manuscripts of the \textit{Haṭharatnāvalī} have \emph{dakṣapādo} in the first \emph{pāda}. This reading yields the same meaning as the adopted one if read with \emph{vāmapādaṃ} in the second. However, \alphaThree\ and manuscripts of the \textit{Haṭharatnāvalī} read \emph{vāmadoṣṇā}, which is not good because it leaves the gerund without an object.\lb

The version of this verse in \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.26), which is supported by some manuscripts in two important groups, \textpi\ and \texteta, has two objects of the gerund, namely the left and right feet, without an instrumental or conjunctive particle. In his commentarial remarks, Brahmānanda proposes that the left foot is grasped by the right hand and the right foot by the left foot, as seen in \medialink{Figure 2}{matsyendrasana2.jpg}.

Here we understand \emph{jaṭhara}, which usually refers to the stomach, to mean “tough” or “persistent” (cf.~\emph{Amarakośa} 3.3.740 \emph{jaṭharaḥ kaṭhine'pi syād adhastād api cādharaḥ}).\lb
%We have emended the reading \emph{jaṭhara} found in \emph{pāda} a in almost all witnesses to \emph{jaraṭha} on the understanding that \emph{jaraṭha} and the reading \emph{picaṇḍa} found in the alpha witnesses were original but obscure to many scribes, resulting in various corruptions including the change to \emph{jaṭhara}, which, like \emph{picaṇḍa}, means “stomach”.\lb
%The readings for the compound beginning with \emph{jaraṭha} diverge significantly and include \emph{jaṭharapravṛddha°}, \emph{jaṭharaprabuddha°}, \emph{jaṭharapradīpta°} and \emph{jaṭharapracaṇḍa°}. As descriptive compounds, none of these makes good sense in regard to Matsyendra's seat. Since the stomach or abdomen (\emph{jaṭhara}) is the first member of this compound, it seems more likely that it qualifies the terrible diseases (\emph{pracaṇḍarug}) that are mentioned in the next verse quarter, as suggested by the reading \emph{jaṭharapravṛddha°}, which is attested by \etaTwo\ and the \textit{Yogacintāmaṇi} and suggested by \gammaOne and \deltaOne (\emph{jaṭharapravuddha°}).\lb
% MD 2024-8: The best-attested reading is now jaṭhara-pracaṇḍa-picaṇḍa-ruṅ-maṇḍala°. Perhaps, jaṭhara is an adjective here like jaraṭha: "a troop of tough/persistent (jaṭhara/jaraṭha) and terrible abdominal (picaṇḍa) diseases"? >>>>>JM: yes, let's keep jaṭhara but understand it to mean tough, which is apparently possible. Then no need for a note, or rather just a short one to say we understand jaṭhara to mean tough/persistent (found in Amarakośa (3.3.740)  jaṭharaḥ kaṭhine'pi syādadhastādapi cā'dharaḥ\\

In 1.27d, the compound \emph{daṇḍasthiratvaṃ} (`steadiness of the spine') is attested by all the important manuscript groups and testimonia, so it was likely original. However, the \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.27d) has \emph{candrasthiratvaṃ} (`steadiness of the moon'), and this reading is well-attested in many manuscripts that are lower on the stemma. Brahmānanda understands steadiness here as `the absence of flow' (\emph{sthiratvaṃ kṣaraṇābhāvaṃ}), a reference to the moon retaining its nectar.

The reading \emph{dorbhyāṃ padāgradvitayaṃ} is well attested but is somewhat strange because \emph{dos} usually means `the arm' rather than the hands. The variant \emph{dvābhyāṃ karā\-bhyāṃ dvitayaṃ}, “with both hands”, appears to be an attempt to remove \emph{dorbhyāṃ}, but it introduces the problem of the toes not being mentioned.

There is no direct source of this verse, but it has the same elements as two verses in the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā} (1.76–77), which are themselves derived from earlier Vaiṣṇava sources (see Mallinson 2014: 227 n.\,9). The compound \emph{uccāsanaḥ} in the third verse quarter seems to approximate in a somewhat vague way the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}’s reading \emph{samunnataśiraḥpādaḥ}. \lb
 
In the second verse quarter, the pronoun in \emph{tatkūrpare} refers to the two hands. This is stated more explicitly (i.e.~\emph{hastayoḥ kūrparau}) in \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā} 1.76c and \emph{Yogayājñavalkya} 3.15c.

The glorious peacock posture uickly cures all illnesses, beginning with bloating and abdominal diseases, and overcomes humoral imbalances. It reduces to ash food which is bad or has been eaten to excess, kindles the digestive fire and causes strong poison to be digested.
\end{translation}
%JB: gulmodara appears to always means gulma and udararoga in medical texts: cf. gulmodarayoḥ, gulmodareṣu, etc. PV Sharma translates gulmodara as gulma and udara in both the Suśruta and Caraka. Srikantamurty translated gulmodara as abdominal tumours and enlargment of the abdomen in the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya. Moreover, ayurvedic kośas do not define gulmodara as a disease. And in HP 1.31 sakalaroga might just be the equivalent of sarvapāpavināśana in the VS and sarvavyādhinivāraṇa in the Ahirbudhnya's description of mayūra. So perhaps the best translation is "... quickly cures all illnesses, beginning with bloating and abdominal diseases... JM: yes

The word \emph{tu} is often used to introduce a new posture, but in this case seems to be a verse filler.\lb
 
In the first and third verse quarters, Svātmārāma appears to have rewritten \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} 3.96 to include the information that it was Śiva (\emph{śivena}) who taught the eighty-four \emph{āsana}s, whereas in the source Śiva is himself speaking. Svātmārāma also changes the meaning of the second half of the verse, as the \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} states that Śiva picked out the four best postures and taught them, whereas in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} it reads as though Svātmārāma himself is responsible for picking out the four best postures and teaching them. There are other instances in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} where Svātmārāma borrows a verse with a first person verb (e.g.~3.43). However, in this instance, he may have intended to indicate that he chose the four postures coming after this verse (i.e.~\emph{siddha}, \emph{padma}, \emph{siṃha} and \emph{bhadra}) because the \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} follows 3.96 with teachings on the postures called \emph{siddha}, \emph{padma}, \emph{paścimottāna} and \emph{svastika}. The vocative here (\emph{sakhe}) is also found in \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 4.56, which is also likely to be an authorial verse.

%Another possibility is that Svātmārāma borrowed 1.33–1.34 from an unknown source that contained a dialogue that was different to that of \emph{Śivasaṃhitā}, as indicated by \emph{sakhe} in 1.34.
\end{philcomm}%JM: I don't think the last sentence is needed. There's another sakhe in 4.56 which is also very likely to be an authorial verse.

It is likely that the original version of this verse contained the vocative with the imperative form of the verb (\emph{sakhe tiṣṭha}). There are other instances where Svātmārāma included a verse with the vocative (e.g.~4.7c, 4.56b, 4.72d, 4.74c) as though the text were a dialogue. % MD: I have deleted the instances 4.0*14a and *16d since they are secondary.
Other versions of this verse are transmitted by some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, in which the vocative and imperative verb have been removed. In these cases, \emph{sukhe} and \emph{sukham} are difficult to construe because the context suggests that the intended meaning was that one should always sit in \emph{siddhāsana} (as opposed to the other three \emph{āsana}s), rather than the prescription to always sit in a comfortable \emph{siddhāsana}.

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_035]
In the second verse quarter, the adopted reading \emph{ekahṛdayo} is supported by two manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} (\getsiglum{J2,M1}) and is close to the \alphaOne\ reading \emph{ekahṛdaye}. It is also attested by the six-chapter \emph{Viveka\-mārtaṇḍa} and the \emph{Yoga\-cintāmaṇi}, which attributes this verse to an unkown work called the \emph{Pavanayogasaṅgraha}. In this case, \emph{ekahṛdayaḥ} appears to describe the yogi as having his mind focused on one thing. There are many variations of this verse quarter in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} manuscripts, as well as in the manuscripts of the sources and testimonia. Most of the collated witnesses have \emph{athaikam eva hṛdaye dhṛtvā}, which is close to the adopted reading. Other readings allude here to the practice of the Jālandhara lock, in which the chin is placed on the chest. This is most clearly seen in the \emph{Jyotsnā}'s version, \emph{hṛdaye kṛtvā hanuṃ susthiram} (`having put the jaw firmly on the chest'). The other well-attested reading, \emph{athaikaṃ eva niyataṃ}, was an attempt to fix the problem of \emph{hṛdaye} by replacing it with \emph{niyatam}, which must be read with \emph{meḍhre pādam athaikaṃ} (`having fixed one foot on the penis'), but \emph{niyatam} is redundant here because of \emph{vinyaset} in the first verse quarter.     

%The compound \emph{āsyahṛdaye} is supported by other manuscripts, such as \getsiglum{N10,P1,P6,J16} and the variants \emph{asyahṛdaye} and \emph{asyahṛdayaṃ} also occur (e.g.~\getsiglum{J7,J12,A1,V4,V18,V16,P8,P9}).

Most witnesses have \emph{suṣumṇām} as the object of the verb \emph{abhyaset}, which is odd. %

%This reading is well attested by manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} and is also found in the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi}, which attributes it to the \emph{Yogasāramañjarī}. Perhaps, the second line was added somewhat haphazardly by Svātmārāma, and then 
%
Others have tried to make sense of this by changing \emph{suṣumnām iva nāḍiṣu} to \emph{nāḍīnāṃ malaśodhanam}, which occurs in the \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.39), \emph{Kumbhakapaddhati} (120), and \emph{Haṭhayoga} (quoted in the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi}, f.\,79r). This variant reading is probably a patch
and is probably a patch as no other texts say that \emph{siddhāsana} clears the channels. It could have been borrowed from verse 3.102*1ab, which has the same half-verse and was added to the section on \textit{śakticālana}.
%However, the idea of purifying the channels can be found in other contexts (e.g.~\emph{Kumbhakapaddhati} 120) and may hark back to an earlier notion of flushing (\emph{cālana}) the channels (e.g.~\emph{Amṛtasiddhi} 11.6).% somewhat haphazardly? I don't %understand the second part of the note: purifying the channels is found all over the place.
%JB: The point is: no other texts say that \emph{siddhāsana} clears the channels. 
% MD: the same half verse with nāḍīnāṃ malaśodhanam/e appears as 3.102*1ab. Better to mention?

%The reading \emph{na kumbhasadṛśo 'nilaḥ} (`no breath like a retention') is the lectio difficilior and attested by two early witnesses (\etaOne\ and \etaTwo) and is possibly original. However, the \textalpha\ manuscripts and several other important witness groups have the adopted reading \emph{kumbhaḥ kevalopamaḥ}, as well as the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} and some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī}, suggesting that this reading, which makes much better sense, was in the transmission at an early stage.    
% Śivasaṃhitā has \emph{kumbhasadṛśaṃ balam}.
% MD: I think kevalakumbha is indispensable after the comparison in 1.41-42. It seems more likely to me that this is the original text of Svātmārāma and that the eta group was influenced by the source text.

%\emph{vakṣasyāsthāpya} is a marmasthāna

%(MD 2024-5-14): It is remarkable that α2 and π1 have osthāpyot and ζ3 otthāpya. Perhaps o = ava as in the Middle Indic? avasthāpya would make the perfect sense.

The syntax of this verse as we have presented it is incomplete: at its end \emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ}, `the breath gradually', is left hanging. In the source text, the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra}, the following verse completes the syntax with \emph{pūrayed}, “one should inhale”. Either Svātmārāma chose to leave the verse hanging (the following verse in the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} adds nothing about the form of the posture, which is the topic here) or the verse that completes the syntax fell out, perhaps because of a scribal error that happened early in the transmission. In the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} verses 36 and 37 both end with \emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ}, the repetition of which may have caused an eyeskip.\lb

The manuscript readings with \emph{vakṣa sthāpayet} (\piOmega\ and \etaTwo) or something similar (\etaOne) do not offer a solution to the incomplete syntax and do not indicate that Svātmārāma rewrote \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 36 so that he could omit \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 37. (The readings \emph{osthāpyot} (\alphaTwo\ and \piOne) and \emph{otthāpya} (\zetaThree) are surprising and are perhaps Middle Indic forms in which Sanskrit \emph{ava-} becomes \emph{o-}.) In the absence of evidence that Svātmārāma included \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 37 or wrote a coherent version of \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 1.46, we have made sense of \emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ} by adding “[draw in]” in our translation.\lb

Brahmānanda's comment on the statement, `having raised the root of the uvula with the tongue' (\emph{rājadantamūlaṃ ca jihvayā uttabhya}) in 1.46 is worth noting. In the context of Haṭhayoga, one would assume this statement to be referring to a type of  \emph{khecarīmudrā}, in which the tongue lifts the root of the uvula, here called the `royal tooth' (\emph{rājadanta}, on the meaning of which see Mallinson 2007: 209 n. 258). However, Brahmānanda understands it differently (synonyms omitted for clarity): 
\begin{versinnote}
\tl{rājadantānāṃ daṃṣṭrāṇāṃ savyadakṣiṇabhāge sthitānāṃ mūle ubhe mūlasthāne jihvayā uttambhya ūrdhvaṃ stambhayitvā/ gurumukhād avagantavyo'yaṃ jihvābandhaḥ/\\!}
\end{versinnote}\closer
\begin{quote}
Pushing against both roots of the front teeth on the left and right with the tongue [\ldots] — this fixation of the tongue has to be understood from the mouth of the teacher.
\end{quote}

Brahmānanda appears to have had in mind a probably older rule for meditation postures, according to which the tongue rests near the front teeth. One example of this is in \emph{Svacchandatantra} (4.365f.), which teaches a meditation pose called \emph{divyaṃ karaṇam}, in which the tongue is to rest at the tip of the teeth (\emph{dantāgre jihvām ādāya}). Other Tantric texts have this or similar rules, in which the tongue is supposed to rest either on the teeth or the palate, early examples being the \emph{Mṛgendrāgama}, \textit{yogapāda} 19 (\emph{dantāgre jihvām ādāya}) and \emph{Mataṅgapārameśvaratantra}, \textit{yogapāda} 2.27 (\emph{tālumadhyagatenaiva jihvāgreṇa}). Placing the tongue where it does not disturb the meditation seems quite appropriate for a `normal' meditative practice (The rule of placing the tongue at the palate is also found in \emph{Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati} 18.120: \emph{tāluke jihvāṃ saṃyojya kiñcidvivṛtavaktro dantair dantān asaṃspṛśan ṛjukāyaḥ}. For similar references in tantric and other works see Mallinson 2007: 17–24.).\lb

When the context is haṭhayogic physiology, placing the tongue at the uvula, which is the source of `nectar', is more appropriate. Confusingly, yogic terminology includes many names for the uvula, and among these especially the term \emph{rājadanta} may give rise to confusion, since, as we have seen, the tongue might also in some yoga systems be placed at the front teeth.\lb

Furthermore, the haṭhayogic \emph{khecarīmudrā} has been described in manifold ways. Usually the tongue is said to be inserted into the cavity above the palate but in some cases it is placed at the uvula. Thus the tenth-century \emph{Mokṣopāya} (V.55.14c) says that the tongue rests at the `source of the palate' (\emph{tālumūlatalālagnajihvā}) and the commentary, the \emph{Saṃsārataraṇi}, on the parallel passage in \emph{Laghuyogavāsiṣṭha} V.6.155, which reads \emph{tālumūlāntarālagnajihvā}, explains that this means that the tongue is to be placed in the middle of the two regions of the palate, and that this is the \emph{nabhomudrā}, alias `\emph{khecarī}' (\emph{tālumūlāntarālagnajihvamūlaḥ tālumūlayoḥ kākudamūladeśayoḥ āntare lagnam ālagnam jihvāmūlam yasyety anena nabhomudrā darśitā}/ \emph{yā hi khecarı̄ty ucyate}).\lb

A little later in the \emph{Mokṣopāya} (V.78.24ab) it is made clear that one should reach the uvula, `at the root of the palate' (\emph{tālumūlagatāṃ yatnāj jihvayākramya ghaṇṭikām}). In view of this background we must conclude that the author of the \emph{Jyotsnā} was probably not aware of the yogic meaning of \emph{rājadanta} and has tried his best to make sense of the passage, echoing the idea of the two roots of the palate (although his text is not talking about the palate), but then referring to the instruction of the teacher for practical details, probably noticing that his literal interpretation is somewhat opaque. In addition to his commentary on 1.46 (translated above), Brahmānanda’s comments on \emph{rājadantasthajihvāyām} at 3.22 indicate that he thought the \emph{rājadanta} refers to the front teeth (\emph{kutaḥ}?\emph{yato dantānāṃ rājāno rājadantā rājadanteṣu tiṣṭhatīti rājadantasthāḥ, rājadantasthā cāsau jihvā ca tasyāṃ rājadantasthajihvāyāṃ bandhaḥ, taduparibhāgasya sambandhaḥ śastaḥ}).

In this context, the word \emph{durlabham} is somewhat ambiguous as to whether the posture is hard to perform or hard to acquire (the more usual meaning). In commenting on \emph{durlabham} in \emph{Jyotsnā} 2.74, Brahmānanda glosses it as \emph{duṣprāpam}, which means `difficult to attain' and `inaccessible.'\lb 

The comment added to this verse by Svātmārāma indicates that he prefers the second version of \emph{padmāsana}, which derives from the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra}, rather than the one he has borrowed from the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}.

Furthermore, this verse is from the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} (36), and the teachings of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} are attributed to Gorakṣa, not Matsyendra. However, in the extended recension of it known as the  \emph{Gorakṣaśataka},  \emph{Gorakṣasaṃhitā}, etc. the second verse includes homage to Mīna, i.e. Matsyendra.

The text at end of the second verse quarter is uncertain. Later witnesses, including Brahmānanda, have \emph{dhyāyaṃś ca} but none of the early ones has this reading. We are taking \emph{dhyānaṃ} with \emph{sannidhāya}, but this renders \emph{tat} problematic because it has no clear referent. In the source text, the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}, \emph{tat} appears to refer to the \emph{mokṣadvāra} broken by \emph{kuṇḍalinī}, which is mentioned in the previous verse. \lb

The two participles \emph{proccālayan} and \emph{muñcan} imply that the two things are happening at the same time, which is surprising but perhaps possible.

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_049]
It is not unusual to read forms from \emph{pṝ} with the locative as seen in this verse (cf.\,\emph{pūrayen mukhe} in \emph{Amaraugha} 21d) but it is not clear what is meant here. \emph{Siddha\-siddhānta\-paddhati} 1.66 identifies the ten \emph{dvāra}s at which the ten principle channels terminate, and adds that all other channels terminate at the pores of the skin. Perhaps the primary \emph{nāḍīdvāra}s are intended here, and the yogi is to fill himself up with air through each of them. Alternatively, the meaning could be that by filling the \emph{dvāra}s with air, the yogi is blocking them, thus enabling the stilling of the breath as described in some secondary readings in the second half of the verse. This appears to be how this verse is understood at \emph{Haṭhatattvakaumudī} 17.30 (cf.~\emph{Yogatattvopaniṣad} 141–142).\lb

The \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.49) has \emph{nāḍīdvāreṇa} instead of \emph{nāḍīdvāreṣu}, which Brahmānanda understands to mean “by way of the opening of the central channel (\emph{suṣumnāmārgeṇa})”. This yields the idea of filling up the central channel (as opposed to other channels), which is described in the \emph{Yogabīja} (94–95).\lb 

%\gammaOne's reading of \emph{niyatam} (instead of \emph{dhārayed}) in the third verse quarter explains the passive verbs in other witnesses. The passive verbs do not make sense with \emph{yas tu}. The passive verbs meaning to take in the breath (e.g.~\emph{pīyate}) may have been adopted to remove the reference to holding the breath because a breath retention is not mentioned in the previous verse describing \emph{padmāsana} (only inhalation and exhalation). \lb

In order to make sense of this verse we have understood \emph{mārutaṃ} to be read with the preceding line, as the object of \emph{pūrayan}. Such enjambement is rare in \emph{haṭha} texts (other than the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra}) and is absent from the verses which we have identified as authorial. We have not identified a source text for this verse but the enjambement and its unusual teaching suggest that there may be one. The unusual enjambement accounts for many of the variants in the second line, with \alphaTwo \ reading \emph{mārutaṃ mārayed yas tu}, invoking an alchemical metaphor for stilling the breath as found in the \emph{Amṛtasiddhi} (see Mallinson 2025). The reading \emph{dhārayet} found in some later witnesses may have resulted from confusion over the meaning of \emph{mṛ} in this context.  % JM to change note: In \emph{pāda} c, \alphaOne\ and \alphaThree\ read \emph{mārutaṃ mriyate yas tu}, which does not make sense with the correlative clause \emph{sa mukto na saṃśayaḥ} in \sl{pāda} d. Nor too does \emph{māruto mriyate yas tu} as found in \zetaOne. We have thus adopted the reading of \alphaTwo, \emph{mārutaṃ mārayed yas tu}, which we are usually reluctant to do when it reads against \alphaOne \ and \alphaThree \ as it often patches problematic readings. \alphaTwo’s \emph{mārayet} is supported by the reading \emph{dhārayet} found in some later witnesses, which may have resulted from confusion over the meaning of \emph{mṛ} in this context.
% JM to Mitsuyo: is my explanation about alphatwo above ok? Or do those other readings not support it? [MD: The reading is unique to J5. Not supported by any other ms.]
%but J5 is contaminated (so the Gr3 reading dhārayet is more reliable).
% ed needs changing to mārutaṃ mārayed yas tu, and pūrayan
% some  mss from the full collation do have yasya
%MD 2024-8: the reading of α1 is "pūrayet/ mārutaṃ (not māruto) mriyate yas tu".
%JM: how about we adopt mārutaṃ mārayed yas tu (then no need for an emendation)? I rather like pūrayan too (with a causal sense: by filling/blocking the openings of the channels...). Agreed, but note alternatives. Go for pūrayan, but explain.

Spreading the fingers and keeping the mouth wide open mimic a lion, and this is depicted in some iconography of Yoganarasiṃha (for example, Yoga Narasimha, Vishnu's Man-Lion Incarnation, Samuel Eilenberg Collection, Bequest of Samuel Eilenberg, 1998, Accession Number: 2000.284.4. \url{https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39251}).\lb

The second line can be interpreted in different ways. One possibility is to understand \emph{nāḍiśuddhiṃ} as a \emph{bahuvrīhi} qualifying \emph{mudrādipavanakriyām} in the sense that the yogi should practise the breathing techniques by way of the relevant \emph{mudrā}s and locks (taught in the third chapter), from which purification of the channels arise. Alternatively, one could separate \emph{mudrādi} from \emph{pavanakriyām} and understand three different techniques here, namely, the practice of purifying the channels (perhaps by the alternative nostril method mentioned at the beginning of the second chapter), the \emph{mudrā}s and the breathing techniques of \emph{prāṇāyāma}. The absence of a conjunctive particle, such as \emph{ca}, makes the second interpretation less likely. The version of this verse in the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} (cited in the testimonia) was changed to make it clear that \emph{nāḍiśuddhi} and \emph{pavanakriyā} with \emph{mudrā}s are two distinct things.

1.55*1–2 are omitted from the \textalpha, \textgamma, \textdelta\ and \textzeta\ groups, so it is likely these verses were not in the earliest versions of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}. In fact, it appears that both were added (perhaps initially as marginal notes) to elaborate on the word \emph{kriyā} in 1.55d. Both verses are similar to verses from the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} (cited as the source). However, only the first half of \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 47 is given in these later versions of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, resulting in a near-nonsensical line. Also, the syntax of 1.55.2ef is corrupt. One has to emend to \emph{deyā} to make sense of it. These verses (except 1.55.2ef) appear in the \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.65–66), but towards the end of chapter one.

Verse 1.55.3 is only found in manuscripts of the \textdelta\ group. It is very difficult to find a reason why it should be inserted here. It is apparently a \emph{muktaka} that would befit an accomplished mystical poem more than an instructional manual, like the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, even here, in what appears as a sort of miscellaneous section at the end of a chapter. In this verse, the lyrical subject wonders about why the mind is still able to doubt, despite its insight into the nature of reality. The reader might wonder how this illusionist verse could be understood to fit this yoga text. We can only speculate that perhaps the scribe of the hyparchetype of the \textdelta\ manuscripts was fond of it.\lb

The source is, as far as we can say, the \emph{Śāntiśataka} of the Kashmirian poet Sillana or Silhaṇa. The manuscripts of the \emph{Svātmopalabdhiśataka} give the name as \emph{Sillana}, the mostly Bengali manuscripts of the \emph{Śāntiśataka} read \emph{Śilhaṇa}, as does Aufrecht in his \emph{Catalogus Catalogorum}, 1891 (for further details see Hanneder 2026). Sillana cannot be dated with any certainty but predates the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} by a few centuries. The edition of the \emph{Śāntiśataka} – where a hundred original verses had to be identified – places the verse in question into an appendix of doubtful stanzas (see Schönfeld 1910: 90 [A9]). However, the editor did not provide a compelling reason to regard it as unoriginal except only the fact that it is not transmitted in all manuscripts. What prevents further investigation of the matter is the lack of Kashmirian manuscripts for the \emph{Śāntiśataka} and its compilatory character: one quarter of the material is identical with Bhartṛhari's \emph{Vairāgyaśataka}. A still superficial glance at Sillana's \emph{Svātmopalabdhiśataka} gives the impression that our verse would fit there, but not so much in the \emph{Śāntiśataka}. Perhaps its first citation is in Advayavajra’s \emph{Tattva\-ratnāvalī} (24). While these are only preliminary observations the verse is likely not original to the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}.

This verse was omitted from \etaOne, the oldest dated manuscript. The omission is probably deliberate as that manuscript does not have chapter four, which teaches \emph{nādānusan\-dhāna} and the numbering in \etaOne\ indicates that its exemplar included the verse.\lb

%The term \emph{kumbhaka} is almost always masculine [ neuter also in 2.53, 2.68 and the heading before 2.72 (MD)] but appears in this verse as a neuter in the majority of manuscripts of the important groups.\lb

%Marmasthāna: not clear whether to adopt \emph{citro} or \emph{citraṃ}, or V19’s \emph{mudrākhyaṃ karaṇaṃ tathā} or the others’ \emph{mudrādikaraṇāni ca}.

This verse is similar to 1.65, which has \emph{mudrādikaraṇāni ca}, so perhaps it was through confusion with 1.65 that the same reading is found in some witnesses of 1.56. It seems that each of the four auxiliaries (\emph{aṅga}) of Haṭhayoga is being referred to in the singular (hence \emph{āsanaṃ}), whereas in 1.65 the plural is used (i.e.~\emph{pīṭhāni}) which is why we have adopted the reading \emph{citraṃ} [...] \emph{karaṇaṃ tathā}.

The readings \emph{tyāgī} and \emph{yogī} are both well attested in \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 1.57b. The confusion between the two appears to have started early in the transmission of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}. The occurrence of \emph{tyāgī} in \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} 37 may be a dittographical type of mistake because the word \emph{tyāgī} is in the previous line of that work. But it is more difficult to determine whether Svātmārāma used a manuscript of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} with \emph{tyāgī} or \emph{yogī} in verse 37. Since the best \textalpha\ manuscript has \emph{yogī}, as well as \etaOne\ and many others, we have tentatively adopted it bearing in mind that it was changed early in the transmission of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, most likely by a scribe who knew the reading of \emph{tyāgī} in a manuscript of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}.

This verse probably derives from the ‘original’ \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (12c–13b). It is also found, but reworked to be about the \emph{mitāhārī}, in Nowotny’s \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (55), which is an extended recension of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}. \lb

The expression `lacking a fourth part' (\emph{caturthāṃśavivarjitaḥ}) is somewhat vague but probably refers to the idea of leaving a quarter of one's stomach empty, which is stated more clearly in the \emph{Dharmaputrikā} 1.51–52:

And, as noted by Brahmānanda in \emph{Jyotsnā} 1.58, this idea also occurs in the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā} (\emph{Sūtrasthāna} 8.46cd–47ab):

%The compound \emph{kaṭvamla°} (1.59a) is better than \emph{kaṭvāmla°} and it is well attested by manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, as well as in lists of tastes and types of foods in other texts.

On the meaning of \emph{uṣṇa} (1.59a) in relation to food,  Meulenbeld writes (1974: 254 fn. 13):
\begin{quote}
Cakra mentions as a variant: \emph{katvamlalavaṇakṣāra} (pungent, acid, saline and caustic). Cakra remarks that the term `hot' (\emph{uṣṇa}) denotes hot on touch when it occurs the first time, and hot with regard to potency when it occurs for the second time.
\end{quote}

The compound \emph{harītaśāka} in 1.59a is spelt \emph{haritaśāka} in other works. The spelling \emph{harīta} was probably adopted for metrical reasons. In some Nighaṇṭus, \emph{haritaśāka} is glossed as horseradish (\emph{śigru}).
\begin{quote}

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{śigruko haritaśākaś ca mato vai mūlapatrakaḥ/\\!}
\end{versinnote}
\end{quote}

Brahmānanda’s understanding of \emph{harītaśāka} as \emph{pattraśāka} is probably wrong if \emph{pattraśāka} was intended as ‘leafy vegetables.’ But he may have used the term \emph{pattraśāka} in the sense of horseradish (\emph{śigru}) as the dictionary notes that \emph{pattraśāka} is probably equivalent to \emph{śākapattra}, which is mentioned in \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} 7.26 (above).\lb

The term \emph{sauvīra} (1.59b) probably means sour gruel. Brahmānanda glosses  \emph{sauvīra} as \emph{kāñjika}, which is `fermented rice water.' On \emph{sauvīra}, Meulenbeld (1974: 516–517) says '\emph{sauvīra} is sour gruel made from barley and wheat.' The process of making it is described in the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} (1.44.35--40ab) as follows:

\begin{quote}
Roots of trivṛt etc., the first group (vidārigandhādi), mahat pañcamūla, mūrvā and śārṅgaṣṭā, and also of snuhī, haimavatī, triphalā, ativiṣā and vacā -- these are taken and divided into two parts out of which one is decocted and the other is powdered; now, crushed barley grains are impregnated with the above decoction several times, dried and then slightly fried. Taking three parts of this and one part of the above powder are put in a jar and mixed with their (of trivṛt etc.) cold decoction and fermented properly. This is known as sauvīraka. (trans. Sharma 2018 (vol.1): 406)
\end{quote}

However, according to some Nighaṇṭus, \emph{sauvīra} can also mean stibnite (an ingredient in some \emph{añjana}s and medicines). For example, in the \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} (13.86):


\begin{versinnote}
\tl{añjanaṃ yāmunaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ nādeyaṃ mecakaṃ tathā\\+}
\tl{srotojaṃ dṛkpradaṃ nīlaṃ sauvīraṃ ca suvīrajam//\\!}
\end{versinnote}

Note also that the \emph{Yogaprakāśikā} (1.53) takes \emph{sauvīra} with \emph{taila}, perhaps to solve the problem of \emph{taila} on its own (see below for more on this). The compound \emph{sauvīrataila} is explained as `oil produced in the place Suvīra' (\emph{suvīradeśodbhavatailam}). According to Ali (1966: 144), Suvīra is known as a country that was also called Suvira (V.79), Sauvira (XVI.21) and Sauvīraka (IV.23). He identifies it with the Rohri/Khairpur region of Sind. \lb
%( S.M. Ali, Geography of the Purānas, Delhi, 1966, p. 144).

The word \emph{taila} could refer to \emph{tilataila}. This is supported by the following rule (\emph{paribhāṣā}) in the \emph{Śārṅgadharasaṃhitā} (48): %
\emph{anuktāvasthāyāṃ paribhāṣāvidhiḥ} [...] \emph{taile ’nukte tilodbhavam}. We thank Dominik Wujastyk for this reference.  \lb

    The most general Sanskrit term to denote drinks that create a drunken state is \emph{madya} “intoxicating [drink].” Translating this word is hard. “Inebriating drink” is clumsy to my ear. “Intoxicating” contains the unfortunate “toxic” element that is not present in the Sanskrit word, though at least in English this is a common word, applicable to various substances and states and lacking any “toxic” associations in everyday usage.
\end{quote}

In the compound \emph{ājādimāṃsa} (1.59c), the adjective \emph{āja} is required for the metre,  so variants beginning with \emph{aja} can be dismissed. Another well-attested reading is \emph{ājāvimāṃsa}. Although this was probably read as `goat and sheep flesh,' \emph{āvi} is not attested as an adjective of sheep, so this reading was probably not original. Moreover, only \emph{ājādimāṃsa} makes good sense. Diwakar Acharya believes that the prohibition of goat flesh and fish in this verse suggests it derives from the North East of India.\lb

The term \emph{kulattha} means a kind of pulse, translated by Dominik Wujastyk (1998: 77) as `poor man's pulse.'\lb
% Dominik Wujastyk, Roots of Ayurveda, Penguin Books, 1998.

The word \emph{kola} is a name for \emph{Zizyphus Jujuba} \textsc{Mill.}~(Nadkarni 1926: 919--920). It is also known as \emph{badara}. This is how Brahmānanda understands it in \emph{Jyotsnā} 1.59 (\emph{kolaṃ kolyāḥ phalaṃ badaram}). According to Nadkarni, the fruit of the wild variety is very acid and astringent. It is believed to purify the blood and assist digestion. The bark is astringent and a simple remedy for diarrhoea. The root is useful as a decoction in fever and delirium. There are references to \emph{kola} being pungent, though this does not seem to indicate sufficiently why \emph{kola} is mentioned separately in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} as an unwholesome food. Diwakar Acharya has informed us that \emph{kola} can refer to a type of banana in some parts of India.\lb

According to Sharma (1982: 69), \emph{piṇyāka} is 'the remnant paste of oily seeds after pressing out the oil content.’ This can then be made into a cake with a strong flavour, which may account for its inclusion in this list of unwholesome foods (we thank Diwakar Acharya for this information).\lb
% P.V. Sharma, Ḍalhaṇa and his commentary on drugs, 1982.

The term \emph{hiṅgu} means Asafoetida (Nadkarni 1926: 360–361). As to why it might be considered unwholesome, the following comments by Nadkarni give some indication:
\begin{quote}
If long continued, even in moderate doses, it gives rise to alliaceous eructations, acrid irritation in the throat, flatulence, diarrhoea and burning in the urine.
\end{quote}
%\emph{laśuna} = garlic (Nadkarni 1926: 45).

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_060]
Brahmānanda glosses his reading\emph{tilapiṇḍa} with \emph{piṇyāka} (on the meaning of which see the notes for the previous verse).\lb

The meaning of the compound \emph{kadaśanaśākotkaṭaṃ} is not clear. Brahmānanda understands it as a list (\emph{dvandva}) consisting of \emph{kadaśana}, \emph{śāka} and \emph{utkaṭa}, which he defines as bad food, prohibited vegetables and pepper, respectively.\lb

There are various possible meanings of \emph{utkaṭa}. According to some Nighaṇṭus, the word \emph{utkaṭā} can mean pepper  (e.g.~\emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} 5.16 \emph{pārvatī śailajā tāmrā lambabījā tathotkaṭā}) and, according to Monier Williams, \emph{utkaṭa} can refer to Saccharum Sara and \emph{utkaṭā} also to Laurus Cassia (cinnamon). \lb

However, \emph{utkaṭa} can be an adjective that means ‘abounding in’ at the end of a compound. Since this verse consists of many adjectives describing food that is unwholesome, it is likely that \emph{kadaśanaśākotkaṭaṃ} was intended as an adjectival \emph{tatpuruṣa}, in which case it means ‘[food] full of vegetables' \emph{śākotkaṭa} that are `bad food' or, perhaps, `bad eating' (\emph{kadaśana}) in the sense of hard to chew.

In 1.62b, \emph{maṇḍa}, which is supported by \textalpha, \textgamma\ and \textpi, is more likely than \emph{khaṇḍa} (`candied sugar') because the other elements of this compound are dairy products. The term \emph{navanīta} is discussed in \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā, sūtrasthāna,} 45.92. %as follows:%JM:do we need this quote? navanīta is very common
% \begin{quote}
% Fresh butter (\emph{navanīta}) is light soft, sweet, astringent, slightly sour, cold, intellect-promoting, appetiser, cordial, checking, aphrodisiac, non-burning, pacifies pitta and vāta and alleviates wasting, cough, wound, consumption, piles and facial paralysis [...] (trans. Sharma 2018 vol. 1: 434).    
% \end{quote}

The word \emph{sitā} is one of many words for ground sugar. Meulenbeld (1974: 507) comments that \emph{sitā} is `very white and looks like gravel.'\lb

The term \emph{paṭola} can refer to at least two different gourds. Meulenbeld (1974: 569) compiled a list of six possibilities, including \emph{Trichosanthes dioica} \textsc{Roxb}. (`pointed gourd') and \emph{Trichosanthes cucumerina} \textsc{Linn.} (`snake gourd').\lb

% Nadkarni (1954: 863, 518) has two entries on \emph{paṭola}:
%Nadkarni, A. K. (1954). Dr. K. M. Nadkarni’s Indian Materia Medica, with Ayurvedic, Unani-tibbi, Siddha, Allopathic, Homeopathic, Naturopathic & Home Remedies, Appendices & Notes. 2 vols. Bombay: Popular Prakashan. url: https: //archive.org/details/IndianMateriaMedicaK.M.Nadkarni (on 11 Aug. 2017). URL is 1926 edition.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Snake gourd is common in Bengal and cultivated in Northern India and Punjab. The unripe fruit of this climbing plant is generally used as a culinary vegetable and is very wholesome, specially suited for the convalescent.

% \item Smooth luffa is a hairy climbing herb extensively cultivated in several parts of India. The fruit is edible. Medicinally it is described as `cool, costive, demulcent, producive of loss of appetite and excitive of wind, bile and phlegm.
% \end{enumerate}
% Sharma (1982: 156) adds that \emph{paṭola} is a synonym of \emph{kulaka} and is well known as \emph{Trichosanthas dioica} \textsc{Roxb.} Brahmānanda glosses \emph{paṭola} as \emph{kośātakī}, which is \emph{Luffa acutangula} \textsc{Roxb} (Meulenbeld 1974: 586), suggesting that he thought it was some sort of luffa. He also mentions the vernacular term \emph{paravara} for \emph{paṭola}.\lb
%JM: under the name parval it is very common in N.India and a popular vegetable in ascetic communities. This seems like much the most likely referent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichosanthes_dioica
%JB: okay, shall we change the translation to 'pointed gourd'? and the note to:
Singh and Chunekar (1999: 232) identify \emph{paṭola} as \emph{Trichosanthas dioica} \textsc{Roxb.}, more commonly known as the pointed gourd, and they give its Hindi names as \emph{paravala} and \emph{parorāparorā}. It is very common in North India and is a popular vegetable in ascetic communities. Brahmānanda, however, glosses \emph{paṭola} as \emph{kośātakī}, which Meulenbeld (1974: 586) identifies as \emph{Luffa acutangula} \textsc{Roxb}, suggesting that Brahmānanda thought \emph{paṭola} was some sort of luffa.\lb 
%

Groups of five vegetables (\emph{pañcaśāka} or \emph{śākapañcaka}) have been defined in various yoga texts, but such grouping of vegetables does not seem to occur outside of literature on yoga. The earliest reference to a group of five vegetables known to us is in the sixteenth-century \emph{Yuktabhavadeva} 4.22, which attributes the verse to the \emph{Śivayoga}. The same verse is also quoted in \emph{Jyotsnā} 1.65 with attribution to a medical source (\emph{vaidyake}):

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{sarvaśākam acākṣuṣyaṃ cākṣuṣyaṃ śākapañcakam/\\+}
\tl{jīvantī vāstumatsyākṣī meghanādaḥ punarnavāḥ// iti//\\!}
\end{versinnote}

Another verse on a similar fivefold group of vegetables is also cited in the \emph{Haṭhatattvakaumudī} (4.26)

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{pañcaśākas tu–\\+}
\tl{kṣīraparṇī ca jīvantī matsyākṣī ca punarnavā\\+}
\tl{meghanādaś ceti budhaiḥ pañcaśākaḥ prakīrtitaḥ// iti//\\!}
\end{versinnote}

And a group with more significant differences is mentioned in the \emph{Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā} (5.20; cf.~the additional verses in some witnesses as reported in the apparatus).

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{bālaśākaṃ kālaśākaṃ tathā paṭolapatrakam/\\+}
\tl{pañcaśākaṃ praśaṃsīyād vāstūkaṃ hilamocikāṃ//\\!}
\end{versinnote}

It is not entirely clear how one should understand \emph{divyam} (1.62d). Brahmānanda glosses it with \emph{nirdoṣam} (`defectless') and takes it with \emph{udakam}. Ayurvedic sources indicate more clearly that \emph{divyodaka} was understood as rainwater. In a section on types of water (\emph{jalavarga}) in the \emph{Sūtrasthāna} of the \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} (1.27.196–224), rainwater is referred to as `\emph{divyaṃ udakam}' (1.27.198) in a discussion of the properties of water that has fallen from the sky. The compound \emph{divyodaka} is used in other Āyurvedic works to refer to the use of rainwater in recipes and treatments  (e.g.~\emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya} 8.42–43). Also, the \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} (14.4) glosses \emph{divyodaka} as rainwater:

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{divyodakaṃ kharāri syād ākāśasalilaṃ tathā/\\+}
\tl{vyomodakaṃ cāntarikṣajalaṃ ceṣvabhidhāhvayam//\\!}
