%\emph{dṛḍho yogī} seems unlikely as \emph{dṛḍha} usually qualifies a technique, the body, etc. (not worth commenting on as alpha has dṛḍhe).
Many manuscripts of the \textepsilon, \textgamma, \textzeta\ and \textpi\ groups, as well as the \emph{Jyotsnā} (2.1), have the plural \emph{prāṇāyāmān} in 2.1d. The plural is possible here as it could refer to multiple repetitions of the basic alternate nostril breath control technique taught at 2.7–11, or to the different techniques of retention (\emph{kumbhaka}) taught later in the chapter. The variation between singular and plural recurs through this chapter, and we have followed the \alphaOne\ readings, which make good sense. In this case, since the verse is introducing the topic of breath control, the more general sense of the singular is appropriate.

%The \textalpha\ manuscripts, as well as those of various other important groups, have \emph{sarvaṃ} instead of \emph{cittaṃ} in the first verse quarter. The stemma aside, the former makes better sense as a general statement (i.e.~when the wind moves, everything moves, etc.). The reading \emph{citta} only seems to make sense if one understands \emph{sthāṇutvam} as referring to \emph{samādhi} (i.e.~`motionlessness [of the mind]'). As far as we know, such a meaning of \emph{sthāṇutvam} is not attested elsewhere. Nonetheless, Brahmānanda glosses \emph{sthāṇutvam} as \emph{kāṣṭhavat} (`like a piece of wood'), implying that it refers to a yogi in \emph{samādhi} as this simile is found elsewhere in contexts of meditative absorption (e.g.~\emph{Amanaska} 1.27).
%(JM: but we have sarvam now and cittam is clearly wrong; I think this note is unnecessary — sthāṇu can mean a piece of wood or a post and is a byword for motionlessness (but never means samādhi), like kāṣṭha, and we don't want to put people off reading the notes by including too many unedifying ones.) 
% JB: Since we often read against the stemma, I dont think it's very convincing to simply say we are reading with the stemma in cases where there are two well-attested plausible readings. In this particular case, cittaṃ is a plausible reading that's well attested among the collated mss., so I think we should firstly bring it to the reader's attention and then explain why we think the adopted reading is better on semantic grounds. Perhaps, my attempts to do the latter (by tidying up a previous note) can be improved?
In the second verse quarter we have adopted the reading \emph{dṛḍha\-bandhanaṃ} found in most of the \textalpha, \textgamma\ and \textpi\ manuscripts over that found in the source text, \emph{niścalaṃ tathā}, which is also found in some \textdelta, \texteta\ and \textpi\ manuscripts and testimonia. We thus understand it to be the result of a deliberate change by Svātmārāma.\lb

%MD 2024-8: The most plausible reconstruction of the text, based on our manuscripts, is "cale vāte calet sarvaṃ niścale dṛḍhabandhanam" (When the wind moves, everything would move. When [the wind] is still, [everything] would have firm bond.) Would this work? Yes, with calaṃ.

As noted by Brahmānanda, in addition to its primary meaning of immobility, \emph{sthāṇutvam} can also mean the state of being Śiva, for whom Sthāṇu is another name. \lb

%The \alpha\ group is split between the reading we have adopted \emph{vāyunibandhanāt} (\alphaThree), which is close to \alphaOne\ (\emph{vāyuṃ nibandhanāt}), and the widely attested readings with a finite verb, including \alphaTwo \ (\emph{vāyuṃ nirundhayet}). 

%In the fourth verse quarter, most witnesses have something similar to either \emph{vāyuṃ nibandhayet} or \emph{vāyuṃ nirodhayet}, which are likely to have arisen through confusion with 2.3d. The reading we have adopted (\emph{vāyu\-nibandhanāt}) makes better sense with the finite verb in the second verse quarter.%JM: again I wonder whether all this is worth putting in the edition, online or printed. It is our musings that got us to the text we have constituted, but is not very edifying for the reader. JM later note: if any are necessary, it's only the last sentence as the rest is info found in the apparatus
%JB: If edifying means instructive, then I rate our musings highly :) In 2.2b, we are reading against the stemmea (\textalpha\ dṛdhabandhanaṃ) and in 2.2d most witnesses have a finite verb, including \alphaTwo. But perhaps the note can be improved (I dont find it particularly easy to write this one).

%Both \emph{jīvitaṃ} and \emph{jīvanaṃ} are possible in the second verse quarter. The former is well supported by the manuscripts of several important groups (\alphaOne's \emph{jītaviṃ} seems to be the result of a transposition of the \emph{vi} and \emph{ta}), the source text (the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}) and the testimonia.  

%We believe that \emph{nirundhayet} was probably the original reading and that it was changed to the more correct form of \emph{nirodhayet} and, in some cases, confused with the final verse quarter of the previous verse and changed to \emph{nibandhanāt} (\alphaOne) or \emph{nibandhayet} (\alphaThree\textpi).%JM: necessary note?
%JB nirundhayet is not supported by alpha.
%MD: Why is the reading vāyuṃ nibandhayet not possible, when we have vāyunibandhanāt in 2.2d? See also samīraṇam alaṃ baddhvā in 2.10b. The development of the variant readings "nibandhayet -> nirundhayet -> nirodhayet" is much more plausible.
% JB I've commmented on jīvitaṃ/jīvanam because it looks like its unsupported by alpha (alpha one has jītaviṃ). I now see that J5 has jīvitaṃ, so we could eliminate the note if we add this to the collation. But a note might still be helpful here because G4 is damaged at this place, so jīvitaṃ is not so well attested and jīvanaṃ is possible.

%There is a problem in the third verse quarter. Among the divergent readings, the delta manuscripts convey the idea that the impurities are in the central channel  (\emph{suṣumṇāntarasthā}), which makes a defective \emph{ra-vipulā} (there is no caesura after the fourth syllable). This is similar in sense to V2(siglum), which has the reading \emph{suṣumṇā\-madhya\-sthā}. This meaning was accepted by Brahmānanda, who adopted \emph{suṣumṇā\-nāḍī\-sthā}. We are not aware of a reference in another text to impurities in the central channel, however, so we have adopted the reading of the \gamma \ group and \piTwo, which states that the impurites are situated at the sides of Suṣumṇā, understanding this to refer to the secondary channels of \emph{iḍā} and \emph{piṅgalā}. 

%The \emph{ca} at the end of the fourth verse quarter would suggest that two statements are being made in the second half of the verse. The readings of some manuscripts, such as \emph{suṣumṇā susnigdhā} in \zetaThree\ and \etaOne, appear to be attempts to make sense of the \emph{ca}. However, the meaning of \emph{suṣumṇā susnigdhā} (`\emph{suṣumṇā} becomes well-lubricated') seems implausible. In light of the reading in the \gamma \ group and \piTwo, it seems likely that \emph{ca} was simply a verse-filler.
%JM: I think we should adopt alpha1 (and others): suṣumṇā susvasthā. It works, and makes sense of ca. But we'd not be reading alpha1's yāsthā, which looks to be a mistake.

The meaning of \emph{avirodhataḥ} (‘without harm/discomfort’) makes better sense in this context than \emph{anirodhataḥ} (‘without cessation’).

In addition, \emph{avirodhataḥ} is found (and also \emph{virodhahīnam}) in a passage of the \emph{Haṭhatattvakaumudī} (36.6–9) that appears to have been loosely based on \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 2.7–9.%JM: do we need to quote this? I don't think so.

If [the yogi] breathes in through Iḍā, he should then exhale the restrained [breath] through the other [channel, i.e.~Piṅgalā]. He should inhale through Piṅgalā, hold the breath sufficiently long and release it through the left [channel]. The channels of ascetics meditating on the two orbs of the sun and moon using this method are purified after three months.

This verse is summarizing the following passage in the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} (63cd--65ab):

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{evaṃ prātaḥ samāsīnaḥ kuryād viṃśati kumbhakān// 63//\\+}

\tl{evam evārdharātre 'pi kuryād viṃśati kumbhakān/\\!}
\end{versinnote}

Without reference to the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra}, the meaning of the second half of the verse is ambiguous because it could be understood as saying that the yogi should practise up to eighty retentions four times a day. In his \emph{Jyotsnā} (2.11), Brahmānanda understands it this way, and takes \emph{śanaiḥ} to mean `gradually' building up to the eighty retentions. In the parallel verses in the \emph{Dattātreya\-yoga\-śāstra}, however, it is clear that twenty retentions are to be practised four times a day.

The manuscript readings diverge greatly in the second line. In the third verse quarter, all of the manuscripts have \emph{prāṇa} in some form (instead of \emph{deha} as found in the source text, the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}). The \textalpha\ manuscript, along with some of the \textepsilon, \textzeta, \texteta\ and \textpi\ manuscripts, seems to state that it is \emph{padmāsana} that rises up again and again in the highest stage of holding the breath (\emph{uttiṣṭhaty uttame prāṇa\-rodhe padmāsanaṃ muhuḥ}). We have adopted a similar reading but with \emph{padmāsane} (\deltaOne and \piTwo) because it makes better sense that the yogi rises up while seated in lotus pose. Another version is seen in \etaTwo, which appears to say that the breaths rise up again and again when one is seated in the lotus pose (\emph{uttiṣṭhanty uttame prāṇā baddhe padmāsane muhuḥ}). However, the verse is about the external signs that might arise in \emph{prāṇāyāma} rather than internal processes. Such confusion has arisen because the verse was taken from the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} without its context, which is a classification of different levels of \emph{prāṇāyāma}, so Svātmārāma needed to include \emph{prāṇarodhe} meaning \emph{prāṇāyāma} in order for the different adjectives to have something with which to agree, and he did so despite the infelicity of \emph{prāṇarodhe} crossing the \emph{pāda} break.

The ability to hold the breath as long as one desires, stimulation of the [digestive] fire, manifestation of the inner sound [and] freedom from disease occur as a result of purifying the channels.%JM: I've changed "resonance" to "sound" for nāda. "resonance" isn't right as it's a quality of sound, not sound itself; furthermore, the quality is one of deep reverberation, which not all internal sounds have.

The reading \emph{ukhālam} which we have adopted in the fourth \emph{pāda} is a vernacular term for vomiting which is found in the \textalpha \ recension but has been changed in some witnesses to more Sanskritic forms, such as \emph{udgāram} and \emph{pra\-kṣā\-lyam}.\lb
% MD: Why don't we adopt the reading ukhāla? ukhāla seems to mean "vomiting" in Hindi, Marathi, Nepali etc. See also https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ukhala-pakhala. We have accepted pakhāla in 2.26. Apparently they belong together. 

Many manuscripts, including several of those collated (i.e., \etaTwo, \piTwo \ and \piOmega), and the \textit{Jyotsnā} (2.24), add two verse quarters stating that the length of the cloth is fifteen cubits (\emph{hastapañcadaśena tu}) and that the practice should be performed according to the guru’s teachings (\emph{gurūpadiṣṭa\-mārgeṇa}). These additions are absent from the \textalpha, \textgamma\ and \textzeta\ groups. Moreover, the compound \emph{hastapañcadaśena} does not fit the syntax of the sentence, while the \emph{pāda} referring to the guru's teaching is a cliché that was probably inserted as a verse filler when with the \emph{pāda} on the length of the cloth was added.

The verb \emph{dhāvanti} is a play on words, using a different root \emph{dhāv}, “run”, from that of \emph {dhauti}, which is related to \emph{dhāv}, “purify”. \lb

Twenty phlegmatic diseases are enumerated at \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} \emph{sūtrasthāna} 20.17, a chapter on major diseases (\emph{mahārogāḥ}). %The other diseases mentioned in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}'s verse on \emph{dhauti}, namely cough (\emph{kāsa}), wheezing (\emph{śvāsa}), splenitis (\emph{plīha}) and skin diseases (\emph{kuṣṭha}), are not among them. The likely reason for this is that these particular diseases are not solely caused by phlegm disorders. For example, \emph{Carakasaṃhitā}, \emph{sūtrasthāna} 19.4 states that the five types of spleen diseases are caused by wind, bile, phlegm, commingling of the humours (\emph{sannipāta}) and blood, and the five types of cough arise from wind, bile, phelgm, injury, and wasting.%JM: I don't understand the import of the second part of the note — the text doesn't imply that the first ailments listed should be among the twenty kapha diseases.

%The J10 group has \emph{°bhavaṃ}, which would qualify \emph{gulmaplīhodaram}. (seems to be an improbable reading because then sakalāmayāḥ is unqualified, thus rendering the statement that basti cures all diseases.
We have assumed that the compound \emph{gulmaplīhodara} is referring generally to swelling (\emph{gulma}), spleen disorders (\emph{plīhan}) and stomach diseases (\emph{udara}), but the terms \emph{gulma} and \emph{plīhodara} can refer to more specific diseases. In \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā, uttaratantra} 42.4, \emph{gulma} is defined as a movable or immovable round lump (\emph{granthi}) that might arise between the heart and lower abdomen (\emph{basti}) and can grow or shrink:

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{hṛdbastyorantare granthiḥ saṃcārī yadi vā 'calaḥ/\\+}
\tl{cayāpacayavān vṛttaḥ sa gulma iti kīrtitaḥ//\\!}
\end{versinnote}

The compound \emph{plīhodara} is the name of a specific disease, which is defined in the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} (\emph{nidānasthāna} 7.14–15) as enlargement of the spleen (\emph{plīhābhivṛddhi}) so \emph{gulmaplīhodara} might be referring more specifically to abdominal lumps and splenomegaly.
%Diwakar thinks that \emph{gulmodara} and \emph{plīhodara} should be read. Search āyurvedic commentaries on this. (homework) JB: I can find strong evidence for a disease called plīhodara, but not gulmodara (which usually occurs in longer compounds and is translated by P.V. Sharma as gulma and udararoga: e.g.~Suśruta 1.45.221ab, 1.46.196ef, 6.39.217, 6.40.180)

Manuscripts \etaTwo\ and \piOmega\ have an alternative reading for the third verse quarter that explains the name of the practice: it is called the elephant technique `because the speed of the breath is like that of water [propelled] by elephants’ (\emph{karibhir iva jalasya vāyuvegāt}). The syntax of this reading is not so easy to construe with the rest of the verse, which suggests that it was not original. The reading we have adopted (\emph{kramaparicayavaśya}...) is attested by manuscripts of the most important groups and the same witnesses preserve \emph{mārga} (rather than \emph{vega}). %

%The \emph{Jyotsnā} and printed editions have a finite verb in the first line and assume a plural subject (i.e.~\emph{yoginaḥ}) instead of the feminine singular present participle (agreeing with \emph{gajakaraṇī}). (JB not necessary as alpha, etc. support udvamantī)

\begin{philcomm}[hp02_030]
In this verse and the next the \textalpha \ witnesses read \emph{nīti/nītiḥ} for the name of this practice. These and related terms are found in various north Indian vernaculars with meanings appropriate for a practice in which a string is pulled back and forth through the nose and mouth. In modern colloquial Bengali, \emph{niti} can mean the string used to spin a top and is likely to be connected with \emph{neta/netā} which means a small piece of cloth. In modern Hindi and Gujarati \emph{netī} means the cord of a churning stick and is cognate with Sanskrit \emph{netra} (Turner 1966: 427, entry 7588). In Old Hindi \emph{neta} can have the same meaning or be a kind of silk cloth (Callewaert s.v.). In Oriya \emph{neta} means “a kind of silk cloth worn by girls” (Praharaj s.v.). We thank Lubomír Ondračka for alerting us to several of these references.\lb

The Hindi form of the name for this practice, \emph{netī}, is very well established nowadays, but Svātmārāma’s original readings in this and the following verse were clearly \emph{niti} and \emph{nīti} (vowel length was perhaps not important in the vernacular from which the name was taken). This is confirmed not just by \textalpha’s readings at 2.30d but also by 2.31d where only the short first vowel of \emph{niti} works metrically (some witnesses have rewritten the \emph{pāda} in order to use the spelling \emph{netī}). We might thus surmise that, like \emph{laulī}, the practice, or at least its name, was taught to Svātmā\-rāma by Gauḍas, because it is only from Bengal that we have evidence of the use of the form \emph{niti}.
%JB: "Brahmānanda rewrites.. " It is unlikely that Brahmānanda rewrote 2.31d to accommodate netī as several early manuscripts have this reading (e.g.~eta two, pi omega etc.)

%The reading we have adopted in the third verse quarter (\emph{mukhān nirgamayec caiṣā}) is well attested but may not be original because the first line has a finite verb and the \emph{eṣā} must be construed with \emph{netiḥ} in the fourth verse quarter. The alternative reading \emph{mukhanirgamanād eva} (\etaOne\ and \etaTwo) may be original but is difficult to construe and \emph{mukhān nirgamayet} makes better sense in terms of describing the final part of the practice. 
\end{philcomm}
%</cm30>
%MD 2024-8: The second part of the commentary may be unnecessary. In 2.34, too, eṣā is construed with naulī in the forth Pāda.

%JM to write note expand note on possibility of niti/nīti being original (found in alpha, pione, zetaone, delta i.e. in good manuscripts in most groups; vernacular?) Only niti works well in final pāda. Brahmānanda rewrites to have netī as subject, which would be best. sūtrikā is old — eta1 = V1. In 22 alphatwo has nitiś caiva... Tricky; it seems that the spelling varies here between nīti and niti (in the header it's unanimously nīti in alpha)

We have adopted the reading \emph{caiva} in the first verse quarter, which is attested by manuscripts of the \textgamma, \textdelta\ and \textpi\ groups and is easy to construe. \alphaOne\ and \alphaTwo\ have \emph{vaṭyā} and \emph{kaṃṭhā} respectively, which may derive from \emph{kaṇṭhyā} (\alphaThree, \epsilonOne, \zetaOne), but none of these readings makes sense here. \etaOne\ and \etaTwo\ have \emph{kāryā}, which is unnecessary because of the main verb in the final verse quarter. \lb

Most witnesses, including the \emph{Jyotsnā}, read \emph{jatrūrdhva} in the third verse quarter, which is generally understood as `above the collar bones' or, as Brahmānanda says, the area above the shoulder joints (\emph{jatruṇoḥ skandhasandhyor ūrdhvam upari\-bhāge}). On problems concerning the interpretation of \emph{jatru}, see Meulenbeld 1974: 465. We have adopted \emph{jatrūrdhva} against the reading of \alphaOne \ and \alphaTwo, \emph{hanūrdhva}, ‘above the jaw’, and \alphaThree, \emph{kaṇṭhordhva}, ‘above the throat’.\lb%, which makes good sense in the context of \emph{neti} because it is supposed to cleanse the skull (\emph{kapāla}) or, in other words, the head.
% MD: Now I'm not quite sure whether hanu or jatru is the original, because jatru is lectio difficilior. And ūrdhvajatru seems to be known as the term for the part of the body above the torso, namely the neck and head.

% Different readings exist for the last verse quarter. \etaOne\ has \emph{jayati sā tu sūtrikā}, which is unmetrical, but the word \emph{sūtrikā} may have been original because it explains the problematic readings that arose in the other witnesses when attempts were made to replace \emph{sūtrikā} with \emph{neti}. The variants with \emph{netivit} seem implausible because of the epithets in the first line, which require a feminine noun to be understood as the subject of the sentence. The reading \emph{netir āśu nihanti ca} looks like a patch that was adopted later in the transmission. The reading we have conjectured \emph{jayaty āśu tu sūtrikā} retains \emph{sūtrikā} and corrects the metrical fault of \etaOne\ by including \emph{jayaty āśu}, which is well attested across the stemma.%This note is obsolete because we now have jayaty āśu satī nitiḥ. Just delete the whole para? The note to the previous verse covers this.

The witnesses have many different readings for the first word of this verse. The \textalpha\ manuscripts are split between \emph{modaka} (\alphaOne), \emph{mocaka} (\alphaTwo) and \emph{movana} (\alphaThree). Of these, \emph{modaka} is the most likely, if it is understood as a medicinal pill. However this meaning is rare, even in medical literature, as \emph{modaka} is generally used to refer to a small sweet. We have adopted \emph{moṭakaṃ}, which is attested by \deltaTwo, \epsilonOne\ and \etaOne, as well as the \emph{Yuktabhavadeva}, and which we understand to mean “destroyer” (\emph{muṭa pramardane}, \emph{Dhātupātha} 1.346). Bohtlingk and Roth (s.v.) and Monier-Williams (s.v.) give medicinal pill as a possible meaning of \emph{moṭaka} (cf.\,\emph{modaka}) but it appears that this is mainly an inference drawn only from this verse, where the pill is merely a comparison. Several witnesses have \emph{sphoṭanaṃ} (‘destroying’), which is also possible. \lb

The reading \emph{kapāṭakam} in the second verse quarter is found in most of the witnesses and testimonia and we have adopted it accordingly. The context indicates that it means “shutter” (in the sense of shutting out something), but we have not found any parallel usages of it in this sense.

%\emph{amandācakravegena} could mean the speed of a slightly slow wheel (Jürgen’s suggestion). But this is strange so we have adopted the usual metaphor of a fast moving whirlpool. (JB: varta is overwhelming supported, including alpha)
We have adopted \alphaOne’s readings of \emph{laulī} and \emph{laulika} as the name of this practice in verses 2.34–35 and 2.22 respectively. The vast majority of manuscripts, including \alphaTwo, and the most important testimonia support \emph{naulī} or \emph{nauliḥ} but the names \emph{laulika} and \emph{laulikī} do occur in some more recent works, such as the \emph{Haṭhayogasaṃhitā} (p.\,4), \emph{Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā} (1.12), \emph{Yogasārasaṅgraha} (pp.\,54–55) and \emph{Yogakarṇikā} (p.\,56). The root \emph{lul}, “roll”, provides an etymology for \emph{laulī} and the change to \emph{naulī} can be explained by the similarity in Bengali scripts of \emph{la} and \emph{na} (we thank Lubomír Ondračka for this observation).\lb
%JM: I think we should adopt laulī. Also in 2.22. And 2.35. (Also change dhauti to dhautī passim, in 2.24 it's dhauti metri causa. Also bhātiḥ in kapālabhātiḥ, not bhātī.)
%Lubomir: I would definitely adopt laulī, although I understand your argument that naulī is firmly established. But I think that this is clear mistake. Svātmārāma says that it comes from Gauḍa. I assume that he had in his hand some written source(s) from Bengal. In Bengali manuscripts, the characters of la and na are almost the same, often it is impossible to distinguish between them (that is why some editions have the form vajroṇī: without the knowledge of the vajrolī, an editor can easily read vajronī in the ms a correct it to vajroṇī).
%Interestingly, some Bengali tantric sources still keep the original form and have laulī (Kālītantra, Prāṇatoṣinī), many secondary yogic and tantric texts or compendia have also laulī or lauli. And it is not a coincidence that eastern GheraṇḍaS has laulikī.

\skx{A video of Mahant Bālyogī Rām Bālak Dās performing \emph{laulī} at Dīrgheśvar Mahādev, U.P. is available in the digital edition.}{\medialink{Mahant Bālyogī Rām Bālak Dās performing \emph{laulī} at Dīrgheśvar Mahādev, U.P., in 2012.}{BabajiNauli.m4v}}\lb
%JB what should we do with video links in printed ed? -- MD: \skx{for print}{for web}

%The reading \emph{gauḍaiḥ} is found in only one collated manuscript (\etaTwo) but it is close to the readings of two \textalpha\ manuscripts, \emph{gaulaiḥ} (\alphaOne) and \emph{golaiḥ} (\alphaThree), and is also attested by the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} and \emph{Yuktabhavadeva}. This version of the verse, which is likely original, suggests that it was thought that the name \emph{naulī} came from the region known today as Bengal. The reading \emph{gauḍaiḥ} explains many of the mistakes in other manuscripts, such as \emph{gaulīḥ}, \emph{maulaiḥ}, etc. % MD: Now we have three manuscripts with gauḍaiḥ (π1,γ2,ε1). Perhaps not necessary to discuss the variant readings.

Manuscripts \alphaOne\ and \alphaTwo, \epsilonOne, \zetaOne\ and \piTwo\ have \emph{tundāgni} (or a very similar reading) in the first verse quarter. This reading is also supported by all of the manuscripts collated for the published edition of the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī}. The compound \emph{tundāgni} is rare in Sanskrit literature but it was likely used here because the term \emph{tunda} appears in the previous verse, which explains how \emph{laulī} is done. The compound \emph{tundāgni} is synonymous with \emph{udarāgni}, \emph{jaṭharāgni}, \emph{śarīrāgni} etc., which are commonly used in yoga texts to refer to the body's digestive fire. The alternative reading \emph{mandāgni} (`sluggish fire') is reasonably common in contexts of stimulating poor digestion, and may have been introduced early in the transmission to replace the more unusual \emph{tundāgni}. \lb

%We should adopt \emph{pācana} in the sense of digestion (cooking the food in the intestines). \emph{āmaya} makes better sense in the third pāda, and \emph{mala} might have crept in because of the association of this word with \emph{śoṣiṇī}. (JB: Both pācana and āmaya are well attested, so no need to comment).  

Most witnesses and the testimonia have \emph{maulir iyaṃ} in the fourth verse quarter, which expresses the idea that \emph{laulī} was thought to be the best of the \emph{ṣaṭkarma}, and the assonance of \emph{laulī} and \emph{mauli} may have been intended. The alternative reading of \emph{mūlam iyaṃ} in \zetaOne\ and \etaOne\ would suggest that \emph{laulī} is necessary for the other practices, which does not seem to be the case because, according to \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 2.21, the \emph{ṣaṭkarma}s are more like therapeutic interventions.

The word \emph{bhāti} is derived from \emph{bhastrī} (Turner 1966: 537, entry 9424).\lb

\etaTwo\ and other manuscripts have \emph{kuryāt savyāpasavyataḥ} (`left and right’) instead of \emph{recapūrau sasambhramau}. Although one might infer that \emph{savyāpasavyataḥ} is referring to performing the skull bellows breathing alternately through the left and right nostrils, it appears to be a secondary reading because there is no indication of what is moving to the left and right. Such a method of alternate nostril breathing is explained as a variation of \emph{kapālabhāti} in the \emph{Haṭhayogasaṃhitā} (p.\,14):

%The verb \emph{paśyet} in the third \emph{pāda} is well attested among the manuscripts (V1, J10, etc.). However, it often occurs with \emph{bhruvor madhye}, which is rather odd and suggests that the alternative reading \emph{dṛṣṭir} was original. In fact, \emph{dṛṣṭir} is supported by the manuscripts of the source text, the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}, and the testimonia. (JB: This is an old note).

\begin{philcomm}[hp02_044]
On the occurrence of \emph{plāvanī} in this list in many manuscript groups, including the \textit{Jyotsnā}, see the note on verse 2.71.
%In the fourth verse quarter, only some manuscripts of the \textgamma, \textzeta\ and \textpi\ groups have the adopted reading \emph{plāvanīty aṣṭa}. The name \emph{plāvanī} is necessary in this list because most manuscript groups, including \textalpha, and the testimonia contain a verse on \emph{plāvinīkumbhaka} as one of the eight \emph{kumbhaka}s. The alternative reading \emph{kevalī/kevalaś}, which is supported by the \textalpha\ group and other manuscripts, appears to be a mistake because it is not consistent with the idea of \emph{kevalakumbhaka} standing outside the category of \emph{sahitakumbhaka}, as stated in 2.72–75. These witnesses are among those which include a verse on \emph{plāvinī} later in the chapter. 
%
%This idea of two types of kumbhaka is found in the source text from which Svātmārāma borrowed four of the kumbhakas, namely, the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka}. 
%Therefore, it seems likely the word \emph{plāvinī} dropped out of some manuscripts and was replaced by \emph{kevala} because \emph{kevala} is discussed later in the chapter. In fact, \emph{plāvinī} may have been removed by some scribes because its heading is omitted in many witnesses. The reading in V19 and the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} (\emph{sahitāś cāṣṭa}) was probably an attempt to remove \emph{kevalī/kevalaś} from the list.

% MD: It seems to me that the plāvanī verse was added at a very early stage of the transmission. In the manuscripts of the alpha group the heading of plāvanī is missing. Instead, (iti) plāvanīkumbhakam is found after the verse. Very unusual. Is it not possible that originally kevala was counted as the eighth kumbhaka, as in the Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā?

%Three versions of  the first pāda are attested by the manuscripts:\\ 
%1. ā keśāgraṃ nakhāgraṃ ca (Gr3,Gr4c,V1).\\
%2. ā keśāgrān nakhāgrāc ca (N3,V3,J10).\\
%3. ā keśād ā nakhāgrāc ca (Gr2,Jyo).\\
%The second reading is supported by \textalpha\ and 
% (We've read with the stemma)

%When explaining \emph{ā keśād ā nakhāgrāc ca} in his \emph{Jyotsnā} (2.49), Brahmānanda cites a verse stating that if the breath is held forcefully, it escapes through the hair follicles or nails and destroys the body. The ablative with \emph{ā} (\emph{a keśād nakhāgrāc ca}) is also well-attested (group 2 manuscripts), and it would mean the same.
% [JB: this ref is in the discussion below]

An antecedent to the idea of \emph{prāṇāyāma} affecting the whole body (i.e.~as far as the tips of the hair and nails) occurs in the \emph{Baudhāyanadharmasūtra} (4.1.23):

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{āvartayet sadā yuktaḥ prāṇāyāmān punaḥ punaḥ/\\+}
\tl{ā keśāntān nakhāgrāc ca tapas tapyata uttamam//\\!}

\closer
\begin{quote}
{[}The yogi] who is constantly engaged [in practice] should repeat breath retentions again and again. Extreme heat burns as far as the tips of the hair and nails. 
\end{quote}

The meaning of \emph{nirodhāvadhi} is not entirely clear, but all sources and the \emph{Jyotsnā} (2.49) agree on this reading. The original reading may well have been \emph{virodhāvadhi}, “until it is uncomfortable”, which makes better sense but we have decided not to emend accordingly. The problem with \emph{nirodhāvadhi} is that to practise \emph{kumbhaka} ``up to cessation (\emph{nirodha})'' seems to suggest that cessation is not that of the physical breath, which by definition ceases in \emph{kumbhaka}, but of the vital wind (\emph{prāṇa}) within the body. By citing a verse from an unnamed text, Brahmānanda seems to understand this verse as saying that the breath should very carefully (\emph{atiprayatnena}) be held as far as the extremities of the body so that it does not damage the body by exiting through the hair follicles:

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{haṭhān niruddhaḥ prāṇo 'yaṃ romakūpeṣu niḥsaret/\\+}
\tl{dehaṃ vidārayaty eṣa kuṣṭhādi janayaty api//\\!}%
\end{versinnote}

\begin{quote}
When the breath has been stopped forcefully, it flows out through the hair follicles. This destroys the body and also causes skin diseases and the like.

Nearly all the manuscripts have \emph{nāḍījalodarādhātu}, which is difficult to understand because of \emph{jala} (`water') in this context and \emph{ā}+\emph{dhātu} within the compound. This reading is also present in the transmission of the source text for the verse, the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka}, and most of the testimonia. Given the strength of the evidence, we have adopted the reading and understood it as a list of things in which diseases (\emph{doṣa}) may occur. This is consistent with Brahmānanda's explanation (\emph{Jyotsnā} 2.53). He explains \emph{ā}+\emph{dhātu} as \emph{samantāt ... dhātavaḥ} (`the bodily constitutents altogether').\lb

Two later sources attempt to solve these problems. Some of the manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} read \emph{nāḍījālo} (‘in the network of channels’), which makes better sense than \emph{nāḍījalo}, as \emph{jala} usually means water rather than bodily fluid. Brahmānanda understands \emph{jala} as water that has been drunk (\emph{pītam udakam}), which seems far-fetched as the site of a disease. Two old manuscripts have \emph{dare dhātu}, which avoids the need to read \emph{darādhātu}. If one were to conjecture \emph{nāḍījālodare}, the line would mean, `it cures diseases of the bodily constitutents inside the network of channels.'\lb   



%  \emph{nāḍījālodare} (‘inside the network of channels’), which is close to \getsiglum{V3} and \getsiglum{J10} (\emph{nāḍījalodare}). It is likely that \emph{°jālodare} was changed to \emph{°jalodara} in the transmission because of confusion with the disease of a similar name.\lb%JM: we could keep jalo, "in the fluid in the channels" 
%% 

For the idea of \emph{doṣa}s being in \emph{dhātu}s see \emph{Tantrāloka} 28.283cd, where Abhinavagupta says that worldly concepts arise as a result (\emph{dhātudoṣāc ca saṃsārasaṃskārās te ...}). In the \emph{Īśvara\-pratyabhijñā\-vimarśinī} Abhinava\-gupta notes that they are also the source of physical disorders (\emph{dhātu\-doṣakṛtaṃ mūrcchā} ĪPV on 2.15).\lb

The name \emph{ujjāyī} may be a Prakrit form of \emph{uddhmāyī} from the verb \emph{ud-dhmā}, “to blow out”. We thank Diwakar Acharya for this suggestion.

This verse’s source texts are from Kaula tantric milieus and this is reflected in the result of becoming one with the circle of yoginīs mentioned in the next verse.

The compound \emph{rasanātālumūlena} is difficult to understand. In his \emph{Haṭhasaṅketacandrikā} (f.\,79r–79v), Sundaradeva says that the external air strikes the root of the tongue and palate and the upper part of the uvula (\emph{atra muhū} (\emph{mūhū} codex) \emph{rasanātālumūlāhataṃ ghaṇṭikordhva\-bhāgāhataṃ bahiḥsthavāyuṃ vidhāya pibed ity arthaḥ}). More helpful are the remarks of the commentator of the \emph{Yogataraṅgiṇī} (2.39). He says that a hole or cavity (\emph{vivara}) is made by the root of the palate with the help of the tongue. The yogi breathes through it (\emph{evaṃ rasanātālumūlena rasanā jihvā tatsahāyabhūtatālumūlena kṛtaṃ yad vivaraṃ, tena kṛtvā yaḥ yogī prāṇam anilaṃ prāṇavāyuṃ pibet pūrayet, tasya yogino ’bdārdhena ṣaṇmāsena sarvarogāṇāṃ nāśaḥ kṣayo bhavet}/).\lb

The idea of breathing through a hole between the root of the palate and tongue might have been intended by the parallel reading of the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi}: \emph{rasanā\-tālu\-yogena} (‘by joining the tongue and palate'). We have thus translated \emph{rasanā\-tālu\-mūlena} as ‘through the tongue and root of the palate’. It could also imply that the tongue is turned up and back to touch the root of the palate to make a hole that one breathes through (when the breath is taken in through the mouth). The \emph{Kumbhaka\-paddhati} (137ab) states this more clearly:

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{rasanām unmukhīkṛtya sītkāraṃ kurvatā marut/\\!}%
%JM: could kumbhake tasmin (yasmin prob ok) refer to the practice as a whole, not the retention part of it? I.e. "In this kumbhaka" Otherwise it doesn't make sense.
\end{versinnote}
\closer
\begin{quote}
{[}The yogi] turns the tongue upwards and takes in the breath while making a \emph{sīt} sound.
\end{quote}

A similar practice is also described in \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} 3.80:

\begin{versinnote}
\tl{rasanāṃ tālumūle yaḥ sthāpayitvā vipaścitaḥ/\\+}
\tl{pibet prāṇānilaṃ tasya rogāṇāṃ saṃkṣayo bhavet//\\!}

The first finite verb \emph{dhatte} is also supported by some of the old manuscripts, such as V1 and J10. At some stage, the verse was changed to read \emph{saṃsthāpya} to remove the awkward syntax posed by \emph{saṃdhatte} and \emph{vai dhatte}.

%First line is tricky. None of the old mss preserve \emph{sasvanaṃ}, which is in the GŚ and makes good sense. 

%Most witnesses have \emph{hṛtkaṇṭhe}, which we have understood as a dual accusative. One would expect %\emph{kapāla} also to be in the accusative, but we have understood it as a locative sg. with \emph{sasvanam}.

Apart from \alphaOne, the reading \emph{śvasanaṃ} is not well attested. We have adopted it because it provides a plausible subject for the verb \emph{lagati} (i.e.~`breath comes into contact with'). Most manuscripts, as well as the \emph{Jyotsnā}, have \emph{sasvanam} (`with sound'), which requires that one infer that the breath is the subject. 
%Breathing `noisily' is generally understood to characterise the rapid breathing of \emph{bhastrikā}. The term \emph{śvasana} is rarely used in yoga texts and may have been used here to connote audible breathing, for in some other contexts it can mean hissing, sighing and clearing the throat (s.v. MW: 1899).

Only three of the collated witnesses (\gammaTwo, \zetaThree\ and \deltaTwo) have \emph{madhyātarjanībhyāṃ} (`with the middle and index fingers') and this reading is not well attested by the manuscripts of the source text and testimonia. To hold the nose without the middle and index fingers is consistent with the way alternate nostril breathing is done in modern yoga (e.g.~Iyengar 1991: 443–444) as well as in some ritual manuals, as for instance in Sāhib Kaula's \emph{Śyāmāpaddhati}: \emph{dakṣānāmākaniṣṭā\-bhyāṃ vāmaṃ puṭaṃ ca niruddhya} (see Hanneder: forthcoming).   % JH addition
However, the reading of many manuscripts suggests that the nose was held by all the fingers of both hands, except the index fingers (\emph{nāsikāmadhye tarjanībhyāṃ vinā}), which seems highly impracticable, or that the nose was held by only the index fingers of both hands (\emph{nāsikāmadhye tarjanībhyāṃ tathā}). It is likely that scribes changed \emph{madhyātarjanībhyāṃ} to \emph{madhye tarjanībhyāṃ} or \emph{madhyaṃ tarjanībhyāṃ} because of the \emph{pāda} break.

%The reading \emph{vajraṃ} in the first verse quarter is an emendation based on the manuscripts of the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka}, the source text for this verse. Some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} have readings close to \emph{vajraṃ}, such as \emph{vipra} (\getsiglum{V1}, \getsiglum{P15}) and \emph{vakra} (G11), which suggest that \emph{vajraṃ} was changed at an early stage of the transmission. 

In the first verse quarter, we have adopted \textit{vakra} (\epsilonOne), which is close to the reading of the \textalpha\ group (i.e.~\emph{cakraṃ}). In compound with \textit{bhāvaghnaṃ} (\alphaOne, \alphaThree\ etc.) and following the awakening of Kuṇḍalinī, \textit{vakra} makes good sense. According to the manuscripts available to us, the reading of the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (\emph{vajraṃ}) is not in the transmission of the \textit{Haṭhapradīpikā}.

% MD: rewrite the comment. We have adopted the reading vakra-bhāvaghnaṃ.

%The J10 group has rewritten this verse in the masc sg. with \emph{kumbhaḥ}. And this is possible without the \emph{viśeṣeṇaiva [...] kumbhakaṃ tv idaṃ} line. However, it seems that the \emph{viśeṣeṇaiva} line has dropped out because it is in the Gorakṣaśataka. Therefore, the neuter was probably original.

In the first verse quarter, nearly all of the manuscripts, including the \textalpha\ group, have \emph{gātrasamudbhūta} or \emph{gātrasamudbhūtaṃ} (`arisen in the limbs/body'). Both are rather meaningless here. In the first case, the three knots are in the central channel rather than the body. In the second case, it is redundant to say that the breath retention has arisen in the body. It is possible that \emph{samyaggātra} is a corruption of \emph{guṇatraya}, which is attested by the manuscripts of the source text, the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka}, two of the available manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} (\getsiglum{N21}, Bo\textsubscript{1}) and the \emph{Haṭhasaṅketacandrikā}. In the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka}, it is stated clearly that each of the knots arises from one of the three \emph{guṇa}s: \emph{brahmagranthi} from \emph{rajas} (78cd), \emph{viṣṇugranthi} from \emph{sattva} (79cd) and \emph{rudragranthi} from \emph{tamas} (80cd). With the verses on \emph{bhastrā} from the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} having been extracted without the context of the knots and \emph{guṇa}s, the meaning of \emph{guṇa\-traya\-sam\-udbhūta\-granthi\-traya} (`the three knots that have arisen from the three \emph{guṇa}s') appears to have been forgotten early in the transmission of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} and the compound altered as a result. Alternatively it could be that Svātmārāma deliberately changed the compound in order to remove the reference to the \emph{granthi}s being produced from the \emph{guṇa}s.

\begin{philcomm}[hp02_069]
In the first two \emph{pāda}s we are understanding the usually masculine \emph{pūraka} and \emph{recaka} to be neuter nominatives. When explaining this verse, Brahmānanda (\emph{Jyotsnā} 2.68) supplies the gerund \emph{kṛtvā} with \emph{pūrakaṃ} and \emph{kuryāt} with \emph{recakaṃ}, but it is unlikely that the author of the verse intended this. \lb

The compound \emph{vegodghoṣaṃ} is rather unusual. We have understood it according to the commentator Bālakṛṣṇa’s gloss: `an inhalation in which sound is produced by force' (\emph{vegena sañjāta udghoṣo yasmin pūrake}).\lb

Witnesses of the \textgamma \ and \textdelta \ branches of the stemma, and Brahmānanda, have \emph{ānandalīlā} instead of \emph{ānandamūrchā}, perhaps in order to avoid the repetition of \emph{mūrchā}, which is also found in the following verse.

%Old note before mūrcchā adopted. Many manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, including the \textalpha\ group, have \emph{ānandamūrchā} at the end of the verse, instead of \emph{ānandalīlā}, which we have adopted and which is supported by \piTwo\ and the \textgamma\ group, as well as the most important testimonia (i.e.~the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī}, \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} and \emph{Yuktabhavadeva}). The reading \emph{ānanda\-mūrcchā} is probably the result of dittography as the heading \emph{atha mūrchā} follows this verse. It has persisted in the transmission because  \emph{ānandamūrchā} makes some sense by itself (`swooning through bliss'), although when it is read with the rest of the verse quarter, the meaning is somewhat odd (`swooning through bliss arises in the mind').

% JB: the meaning of manomūrcchā is not conveyed by the current translation. Fainting of the mind is different to normal fainting where a person falls to the ground unconsciousness. It's unlikely that the person in mūrcchā kumbhaka was supposed to collapse.... bestows bliss, when the mind faints. JM: Meulenbeld 2011: 127 (on the meaning of mūrch) "Mūrchita designates in literary Sanskrit, and also many times in medical Sanskrit, the state of having fainted/swooned, lost consciousness for a short time. Mūrchā means fainting."

\begin{philcomm}[hp02_071]
Although the important manuscript groups, including \textalpha, have this verse on \emph{plāvanī} (sometimes spelt \emph{plāvinī}), there is substantial evidence to suggest that \emph{plāvanī} was incorporated into the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} and its group of eight breath retentions (\emph{kumbhaka}) sometime after the text was initially composed. Firstly, in most manuscript groups, the name \emph{plāvanī} is absent from the list of \emph{kumbhaka}s in 2.44. The better-attested reading, supported by \textalpha, includes \emph{kevala} as the eighth \emph{kumbhaka} and omits \emph{plāvanī}. Furthermore, most of the principal testimonia, namely the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī}, \emph{Yogalakṣaṇāvalī} and \emph{Yuktabhavadeva}, likewise include \emph{kevalakumbhaka} and omit \emph{plāvanī} in the list of eight \emph{kumbhaka}s. Secondly, the heading \emph{atha plāvanī} is absent from the \textalpha\ group and many other manuscripts. Instead, the \textalpha\ manuscripts have \emph{iti plāvanīkumbhakaṃ} after the verse on \emph{plāvanī}, which is not consistent with the other \emph{kumbhaka} descriptions. Thus,  \emph{plāvanī} was probably not part of the text composed by Svātmārāma and was introduced at an early stage in the transmission of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}.\lb

We have understood \emph{udgāramāruta} to refer to the breath of eructation, i.e.~the \emph{nāga} breath as described in e.g.~\emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} 36.\lb
% We have adopted \emph{payasy agādhe pi sukham} in pāda c because \emph{sukham} gives a better meaning and it is a bha-vipulā

%\getsiglum{V19}, \getsiglum{P28}, the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} and the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} omit this verse and accordingly do not mention \emph{plāvinī} in verse 2.44, substituting it with \emph{kevala}.

In the first \textit{pāda}, we have adopted a reading similar to that of the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}, which is very close to that of \deltaOne \ (\emph{ārecyāpūrya yat kuryāt}) and \deltaThree \ (\emph{ārecyāpūrya yaḥ kuryāt}) and similar to \alphaTwo’s hypometrical reading (\emph{recapūrya y\emph{[}a\emph{]}t kāryaḥ}). It appears that the relative pronoun dropped out of the first verse quarter early in the transmission of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} and scribes have tried in various ways to restore some sense, with several emending to \emph{recakaḥ pūrakaḥ kāryaḥ}. %

% JB: We need the relative pronoun to pick up on the sa in the second pāda
% MD: Not necessarily. Cf.~1.58, 2.24, 2.26.

% Perhaps: recya vā pūrya vā kāryaḥ sa vai sahitakumbhakaḥ "The sahitakumbhaka is to be done either after exhalation or after inhalation." (Cf.~Jyotsnā 2.71: tatra sahito dvividhaḥ/ recakapūrvakaḥ pūrakapūrvakaś ca/). That would be closer to the readings of ε1 and α2.

The reading \emph{kumbhitaḥ}, which is attested by \alphaOne\ and the testimonia, does not make sense here  % do not ? JH 
because the subject must be the yogi (\emph{prānaḥ} would be unmetrical). In other texts, the word \emph{kumbhita} is used to qualify the breath and means `retained' (e.g.~\emph{Yogabīja} 94, \emph{Kumbhakapaddhati} 127, \emph{Yuktabhavadeva} 8.32 etc.).
