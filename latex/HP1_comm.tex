Homage to the glorious Ādinātha who taught the system of Haṭhayoga, which shines forth like a stairway for one desirous of climbing to the lofty terrace of the royal palace.%??JM: would much prefer "science" to "system" (vidyā doesn't really mean system). I changed "ladder" to "stairway" (a bit more poetic). I'd also prefer "which is like a splendid stairway for one who wants to climb to the lofty royal terrace."

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_001]
%?? JM: now saudha is preferred for stemmatic reasons too. I suggest the following shortened form of the note: 
The alpha witnesses read \emph{virājate pronnatarājayogam} while several others have either \emph{vibhrājate} or \emph{°rājasaudham} or both. As explained in Hanneder 2020, \emph{virājate} is stylistically preferable and the comparison between the science of haṭhayoga and a stairway works only with \emph{°rājasaudham}.

%The reading \emph{rājasaudha} is preferable for poetical reasons, as explained in Hanneder 2020, p. 128–130. Also, the \emph{Jyotsnā} explains that the \emph{alaṃkāra} here is a comparison (\emph{upamā}), which consists of four elements: (1) a particle expressing the comparison ?? JM: what's happened here? ALso, do we need to repeat what Jürgen has already written elsewhere?
%The Sanskrit poeticians explain that when some elements of a comparison remains unexpressed we get an incomplete (\emph{lupta}) comparison. Often words like \emph{iva} or \emph{yathā} are missing or the common property, but if we read \emph{rājayoga} we lose the \emph{upamāna} (i.e., \emph{rājasaudha}). One part of the comparison should not be missing. But from the perspective of \emph{alaṃkāraśāstra} the verse has a problem that has surely caused the dilemma: it either leaves the \emph{upameya} or the \emph{upamāna} incomplete. Brahmānanda has mentioned both ?? \emph{yathā adhirohiṇī saudhaprāpikā bhavati evaṃ haṭhadīpikā rājayogaprāpikā bhavati}, but had to supply \emph{rājasaudha} because his text reads \emph{rājayoga}. But to have the \emph{upameya} in the text is odd. Even Brahmānanda could only know of the image (\emph{rājasaudha}) from the alternative reading he did not accept. However, it seems likely that the author would have included the \emph{upamāna} in the text, as in our critical text, so that the reader would know that the upper terrace of the palace is an image for \emph{rājayoga}. It is further likely that the substitution of \emph{rājayoga} for \emph{rājasaudha} was the result of the tendency to insert the word \emph{yoga} in the opening verses of the text wherever possible, even where it does not fit, as can be seen in 1.2d (\emph{haṭhayogopadiśyate}) and 1.3b (\emph{rājayogam ajānatām}). In the latter case the poetical image has also been lost.

The metre of 1.1 is Indravajrā

% JB Oct 11: It might be helpful to translate Brahmānanda's comment for the non-Sanskrit reader: yathā pronnatasaudham āroḍhum icchor adhirohiṇy anāyāsena saudhaprāpikā bhavati evaṃ haṭhadīpikāpi pronnatarājayogam āroḍhum icchor anāyāsena rājayogaprāpikā bhavatīti upamālaṅkāraḥ
% JB: ``Just like one, who wishes to climb a lofty terrace, reaches the terrace without effort by a staircase, in the same way, one, who wishes to climb the lofty royal Yoga, reaches the royal Yoga by means of the Haṭhapradīpikā. This is the (poetic figure called) \emph{comparison}."



% JB: [...] but had to supply \emph{rājasaudha} because his text reads \emph{rājayoga}.

The reading \emph{yogopadiśyate} (\getsiglum{J7,J10,N17,W4}, etc.) is only possible if one accepts that double \emph{sandhi} is a feature of the style of composition, which it is not. This reading appears to have resulted from an attempt to replace the word \emph{vidyā} with \emph{yoga} in the opening verses of the text.%?? JM has taught? surely teaches?

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_003] 
Most witnesses have \emph{rājayogam ajānatām} (`for those ignorant of Rājayoga') in 1.3b. While this reading is well attested by the manuscript transmission of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} and some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} (note the readings of P,T,T1 of the critical edition [Gharote 2009: 5 n. 2] in the testimonia), the reading of a royal path (\emph{rājamārgam}) is consistent with the metaphor of people unable to find% a path in the darkness and, therefore, most probably authorial. 

In 1.1d \emph{kṛpākaraḥ} is attested by the most important groups, including alpha, of the available manuscripts. The readings \emph{prakāśyate} and \emph{kṣamākaraḥ} are attested by some manuscripts in lower branches of the stemma. Since the context is the author helping yogis who have strayed from the royal path, \emph{kṛpākara} makes good sense. As Brahmānanda notes, this compound can be understood as one who is compassionate (\emph{kṛpā} + \emph{kara}) or one who is a mine (i.e., a rich source) of compassion (\emph{kṛpā} + \emph{ākara}). In the Devanagari transmission, the \emph{kṣa} of \emph{kṣamākaraḥ} probably arose as a mistake for \emph{kṛ}.

\begin{philcomm}[hp01_004]   
The word \emph{athavā} (‘or’) is well attested but difficult to construe here. Brahmānanda understands it as conjunction (\emph{athavāśabdaḥ samuccaye}), and this is how we have interpreted it. The variant \emph{mahāyogī} in epsilon one and other manuscripts (\getsiglum{G5,J4,J11,Ko}) is probably an attempt to remove the difficulty of understanding \emph{athavā}. One could emend to \emph{tathā} in light of the attested reading \emph{yathā} (\getsiglum{C7}) but this would be a bold intervention given the weight of evidence supporting \emph{’thavā}.

Two manuscripts of the alpha and delta groups have the variant reading \emph{°virūpākṣaḥ savālikaḥ} (\getsiglum{J5,V19}) for \emph{°virūpākṣabileśayāḥ}. In another alpha manuscript, \getsiglum{N3}, \emph{savālikaḥ} was corrected to \emph{savālmikaḥ}, perhaps in an effort to restore a name similar to Vālmīki, the celebrated author of the \textit{Rāmāyaṇa}.

The alpha manuscripts have \emph{goraṇṭaka}, and several other manuscript groups have \emph{pauraṇṭaka}.  We are yet to find the name \emph{goraṇṭaka} in other Sanskrit texts but it may be a Sanskrit rendering of \emph{Goraṇṭakuḍu}, which is the name of a disciple of Gorakṣanātha in the \emph{Navanāthacaritramu} (Jones 2017: 194 n.3). The spelling \emph{koraṇṭaka} is attested in the \emph{Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati}, and it is reasonably well attested by manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, as well as those of the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} (which also has \emph{gonandaka}).

The compound \emph{siddhapāda} could be a respectful affix. However, it seems unlikely here because it would cross the \emph{pāda} break.

It is possible that \emph{pūjyapāda} could be a respectful affix to the name Kāṇerī. The variant \emph{dhvaninātha} may have resulted from a transposition of the first two syllables of \emph{nityanātha}.

The name Allamaprabhudeva (sometimes Allama Prabhu Deva or Allama Prabhudeva in secondary literaure) is largely transmitted as \emph{allamaḥ prabhu\-devaḥ}, as though it were two names, although some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭha\-pradīpikā} have \emph{allamaprabhudevaś ca} (i.e., \getsiglum{V3,V8,V13,V16,V22,N24,N26,Jyo}) and so do some of the \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} (i.e., P,T,t1 in Gharote 2009: 35 n. 8).

The names Nāgabodha, Nāgabodhi, Naradeva, Nāgadeva all seem possible in 1.8c. The reading \emph{nāgabodhaś ca} is attested across several primary groups of manuscripts.

Many witnesses have \emph{khaṇḍa} and \emph{kāpālika} as separate names. However, Khaṇḍa\-kāpālika is well attested. Examples include \emph{Kathāsaritsāgara} 121.5 ff. (check??), \emph{Bṛhatkathāmañjarī} 10.45 (check??) and Vajrapāṇi’s \emph{Laghutantraṭīkā}, p.45 (\emph{vīrāḥ khaṇḍakāpālikādayaś caturviṃśatiḥ}). It may be a derogatory name for a Kāpālika, coined perhaps by an outsider and connoting something like a defective Kāpālika in the sense of a ‘part-time’ Kāpālika. Alternatively, it could simply refer to one who used a broken skull as a bowl.

The reading of \emph{samāśrayo} in eta one is metrically faulty. 

The word \emph{°jagatāṃ} is probably authorial because it makes good sense with  \emph{ādhārakamaṭha} in light of the cosmological notion that the tortoise supports all the worlds.

The term \emph{maṭhikā} occurs in narrative literature and yoga texts in the sense of a small hut. For example, in the \textit{Kathāsaritsāgara} (12.9.14, 29–30), \emph{maṭhikā} refers to the small hut built in a cremation ground by a young Brahmin who makes as his bed the ashes of the dead girl he had hoped to marry. In several other stories (\textit{Kathāsaritsāgara} 6.6.132, 10.5.89, 12.25.35), \emph{maṭhikā} is the term used for the hut of an ascetic. In an elaborate description of the huts (\emph{maṭhikā}) used for Haṭhayoga, the author of the \emph{Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati} states that the dimensions of the hut are four fore-arm lenghts (\emph{hasta}) high and wide, and it can be made of various materials, such as red earth, ashes, plaster and so on (Birch and Singleton 2019: 17–18).

In the \emph{Jyotsnā} and printed editions of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, including one by Digambara and Kokaje (1970: 6), this verse has the additional hemistich, \emph{dhanuḥpramāṇaparyantaṃ śilāgnijalavarjite}. This hemistich derives from the \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (32cd), which has \emph{°paryante} instead of \emph{°paryantaṃ}. It stipulates that the hut should be built in a place measuring up to a bow length and free from rocks, fire and water. None of the early manuscripts have this hemistich which suggests that it was added at a later time. Nonetheless, it appears in over a dozen manuscripts that were consulted for this edition. These manuscripts are not close to an early hyp\-archetype of the text.

The syntax of this verse is rather problematic. One would expect the features of the hut, which are listed in the first three quarters of the verse, to be in the nominative case. Then, the words \emph{idaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ} in the fourth quarter would refer back to them. However, the compounds in the first three verse-quarters appear to qualify \emph{lakṣaṇa} as though they were adjectives, and this seems to have been the way the verse was composed.     

The manuscripts preserve many different readings at the end of the compound beginning with \emph{arandhragarta°}. The reading \emph{°piṭharaṃ} has been suggested by Dominic Goodall in the sense of potsherds. The idea behind this reading is that hut should be free of rubbish, such as potsherds. One would expect a word for a defect in a hut that is similar to, but not the same as, cracks (\emph{randhra}) and holes (\emph{garta}). For this reason, the reading \emph{°vivaraṃ} looks like a patch, as its meaning does not add anything to \emph{°randhragarta°}. The reading \emph{°viṭapaṃ} (`the young branch of a tree or creeper') is attested among the witnesses of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}. However, it is difficult to construe in this context unless it was intended to refer to creepers or branches that might invade or encroach upon the hut.

(MD: Stemmatically, \emph{piṭaka} ``a basket; a boil" is well attested. Is it perhaps possible to interpret the word as ``a bump"? \emph{a-randhra-garta-piṭaka} would then mean that the floor or walls of the hut are not uneven.)

Manuscripts of several groups, namely beta, epsilon and eta, have \emph{°bādhojjitaṃ}, whereas delta and the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} have the more easily understood reading of \emph{°jantūjjhitaṃ} (‘free from creatures’), which is somewhat suggested by the alpha reading (\emph{jyaṃtyūpsitaṃ} \getsiglum{N3}, \emph{jaṃtūṣṇitaṃ} \getsiglum{J5}, but \emph{bodhojhitaṃ} \getsiglum{G4}). However, \emph{°bādhojjitaṃ} may have been original because it is a rather unusual descriptive compound for a hut, and yet a hut is described similarly in \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} 6.17.67 (\emph{gṛhe nirābādhe}).

It is impossible to be certain about the meaning of \emph{niyamagraha}, as the manuscripts do not indicate whether an \emph{avagraha} (i.e., \emph{prajalpo ’niyamagraha}) was intended. Although \emph{yama} and \emph{niyama} are not included in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} as auxiliaries of Haṭhayoga, verse 2.14 implies that \emph{niyama} is necessary at least in the early stages of establishing a practice. Furthermore, verse 3.82 suggests that a yogi who does not practice \emph{niyama} might obtain success in yoga through the practice of \textit{vajroli}. Ambiguity over the role of \emph{yama} and \emph{niyama} in Haṭhayoga may explain why two verses on ten \emph{yama}s and ten \emph{niyama}s were inserted in some manuscripts after the next verse (1.16). The additional verses derive from either the \emph{Śāradātilakatantra} (25.7–8) or the  \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā} (1.38, 1.53). In the \emph{Jyotsnā}, Brahmānanda reads \emph{niyamāgraha} and takes it as though \emph{āgraha} was implied, which yields the meaning of ‘over-insistence on rules’, and he relates it to extreme ascetic practice.

Alpha and several other groups of manuscripts have \emph{tattvajñānāc ca darśanāt} or something very similar in the second quarter of the verse. The problem with this reading is the meaning of \emph{darśana} by itself (i.e., discernment of what?). The early sources of this verse, in particular the \emph{Śivadharmottara}, indicate that the second verse quarter read as \emph{santoṣāt tattvadarśanāt}, which makes much better sense of the word \emph{darśana} (i.e., ‘seeing the truth’). However, It seems likely that before the time of Svātmārāma other versions of this verse were circulating, in which \emph{santoṣāt} had been dropped, \emph{niścayāt} moved from the first to second verse quarter, \emph{tattvadarśanāt} became \emph{tattvajñānāt} and \emph{sāhasāt} was introduced. It should also be noted that the word \emph{tattva} could have a more specific meaning in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} (4.45–46) as Svātmārāma states that it is a synonym of \emph{samādhi}. In other yoga texts, it can sometimes refer to the practices of yoga (e.g., \emph{tritattva} in \emph{Amṛtasiddhi} 13.12, 14.2--3) or, more generally, to the highest reality or truth (e.g., \emph{Amanaska} 1.2, 1.20–21, 2.17, etc.).

The reading of \emph{aṅgapāṭavam} is attested among many of the early manuscripts, including the main one of the alpha group. Although this compound rarely appears in other yoga texts, a similar term \emph{śarīrapāṭava} occurs in the \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} (2.35) as one of the benefits bestowed by digestive fire (\emph{vaiśvānarāgni}), which indicates that the word \emph{pāṭava} was used in relation to the body and the benefits of yoga. The compound \emph{aṅgapāṭava} seems to imply the optimal functioning of the body. However, the alternative reading, \emph{aṅgalāghava} (‘lightness of the limbs’ or ‘dexterity’) is more common in yoga texts and occurs even in works known to Svātmārāma, such as the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} (\emph{śarīralaghutā}) and the \textit{Amanaska} ([...] \emph{laghutvaṃ ca śarīrasyopajāyate}). Therefore, it is likely that the less common term \emph{aṅgapāṭavam} was changed to the more widely used notion of \emph{aṅgalāghava}, perhaps early on in the transmission, as the latter is attested by manuscripts in several early groups (i.e., beta, gamma and delta).

One might wonder how the soles of the feet could be placed between the knees and thighs. Brahmānanda explains that the region of the shank near the knee should be understood by the word ‘knee’ in this verse (\emph{atra jānuśabdena jānusaṃnihito jaṅghāpradeśo grāhyaḥ jānusaṃnihito jaṅghāpradeśaḥ}). This is consistent with the earliest known description of \emph{svastikāsana} in the \emph{Pātañjalayogaśāstravivaraṇa} (2.46), which states that the big toe of one foot is tucked in between the shank and thigh of the other so it is not seen (\emph{dakṣiṇaṃ pādāṅguṣṭhaṃ savyenorujaṅghena parigṛhyādṛśyaṃ kṛtvā tathā savyaṃ pādāṅguṣṭhaṃ dakṣiṇenorujaṅghenādṛśyaṃ parigṛhya yathā ca pārṣṇibhyāṃ vṛṣaṇayor apīḍaṇaṃ tathā yenāste tat svastikam āsanam}). For a discussion of \emph{svastikāsana} in the Pātañjalayoga tradition, see Maas 2018: 68–69.

Although most witnesses have \emph{tathā} in 1.21a, the word \emph{atha} has been accepted because it is attested by \getsiglum{G4} (alpha group) and \getsiglum{V1} (eta group), the sources and the testimonia. It appears to be verse filler here rather than indicating a temporal sequence of actions. Svātmārāma borrowed the verse on \emph{vīrāsana} from the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}, the redactor of which appears to have adapted its first hemistich from a description of this posture in the \emph{Śāradātilakatantra}. This would explain the rather strange syntax of the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}’s version, in which \emph{adhaḥ kṛtvā} was changed to \emph{athaikasmin}, and \emph{tathetaram} became \emph{ca saṃsthitam}. It seems that \emph{saṃsthitaṃ} must be understood with \emph{ūruṃ} in the third \emph{pāda} in the sense of \emph{saṃsthāpya} (i.e., ‘having placed’).

Different versions of \emph{vīrāsana} are found in earlier Tantras, such as the \emph{Kiraṇatantra} (58.9), Hemacandra’s \emph{Yogaśāstra} and commentaries on the \emph{Pātañjalayogaśāstra}. For a discussion of some of these sources, see Maas 2018: 66–68.

In the first quarter of the verse, the witnesses are split between \emph{nirudhya} (‘having blocked’), \emph{nibadhya} (‘having bound’), \emph{niyamya} (‘having restrained’) and \emph{niṣpīḍya} (‘having pressed’). The source, the \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}, and two manuscripts of the beta and gamma groups support \emph{nirudhya} whereas one alpha manuscript (\getsiglum{J5}) and the testimonia support \emph{niyamya} and another alpha manuscript (\getsiglum{G4}) has \emph{niṣpīḍya}. In terms of blocking or closing the anus by sitting on the ankles, \emph{nirudhya} makes good sense, and \emph{niṣpīḍya} (`having pressed the anus with both ankles') is also possible.  

The word \emph{vyutkrameṇa} appears to describe the position of the ankles. Its basic meaning is ‘against the normal direction,’ which would suggest that the ankles are turned out or crossed rather than placed together naturally. If the yogi is in a kneeling-type position, turning the feet out would bring the ankles together, blocking the perineal area. See \emph{Yoga Mīmāṃsā}, vol 8, no. 2, pp. 29–30 for a discussion of \emph{vyutkrameṇa} and the position of the ankles in \emph{kūrmāsana}, and vol 8, no. 2, Figures 3–6 for photographs of a practitioner performing this \emph{āsana}.

Since there is no known source for this verse other than the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, we can only assume that the reading of eta one was an isolated attempt to simplify the syntax, for it is a singular reading that appears to be unrelated to the other variants.

Since the word \emph{ākarṣaṇa} in one form or other is so well attested in the third verse quarter, the reading \emph{dhanurākarṣaṇaṃ kṛtvā}, which is in epsilon two, as well as the principal testimonia (i.e., the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} and \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī}), fits the overall syntax of the verse. However, it is curious that \emph{kṛṣṭaṃ} (for \emph{kṛtvā}) is well attested in some groups of manuscripts because it seems redundant with \emph{ākarṣaṇaṃ}. However, the following reading in 
Godāvaramiśra's \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} (f. 40r) makes sense of \emph{kṛṣṭaṃ} and might indeed be the original version of the verse: \emph{dhanurākarṣavat kṛṣṭaṃ dhanurāsanam ucyate}.

A different version of \emph{dhanurāsana} is described in the \emph{Haṭhayogasaṃhitā}. On the two versions of \emph{dhanurāsana}, see Hargreaves and Birch 2017.

One manuscript of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} (ms. no. 30051, f. 2v), which was consulted but not collated for this edition, has a scribal comment stating that \emph{dhanurāsana} should be done continuously (\emph{anavarata}) on the left and right sides (\emph{tatra ekam dhanurākarṣaṇāsanam āsanaṃ savyāpasavyapādahastābhyām [abhy]ased anavaratam}).

In the second verse quarter, most of the manuscript groups have a compound with \emph{°doṣṇā} at the end, as seen also in the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi}, \emph{Haṭharatnāvalī} and \emph{Yuktabhavadeva}. The instrumental ending (`with the hand') works well with the gerund (\emph{pragṛhya}) in the third verse quarter and the object (\emph{°dakṣpādaṃ}) in the first quarter. This reading indicates that the right foot is held by the hand of the arm that is wrapped around the outside of the left leg, which would be the right hand (\emph{°dakṣadoṣṇā}) rather than the left (\emph{°vāmadoṣṇā}), as shown in \medialink{Figure 1}{matsyendrasana1.jpeg}.

One manuscript of alpha (\getsiglum{G4}) and most manuscripts of the \textit{Haṭharatnāvalī} have \emph{°dakṣapādo} in the first verse quarter. This reading yields the same meaning as the adopted one if read with \emph{°vāmapādaṃ} in the second verse quarter. However, \getsiglum{G4} and manuscripts of the \textit{Haṭharatnāvalī} read \emph{°vāmadoṣṇā}, which is not good because it leaves the gerund without an object.

The version of this verse in \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.26), which is supported by some manuscripts in two important groups, beta and eta, has two objects of the gerund, namely the left and right feet, without an instrumental or conjuctive particle. In his commentarial remarks, Brahmānanda proposes that the left foot is grasped by the right hand and the right foot by the left foot, as seen in \medialink{Figure 2}{matsyendrasana2.jpg}.

The manuscript readings for the compound beginning with \emph{jaṭhara} diverge significantly and include \emph{jaṭharapravṛddha°}, \emph{jaṭharaprabuddha°}, \emph{jaṭharapradīpta°} and \emph{jaṭharapracaṇḍa°}. As descriptive compounds, none of these make good sense in regard to Matsyendra's seat. Since the stomach or abdomen (\emph{jaṭhara}) is the first member of this compound, it seems more likely that it qualifies the terrible diseases (\emph{pracaṇḍarug}) that are mentioned in the next verse quarter, as suggested by the reading \emph{jaṭharapravṛddha°}, which is attested by eta two and the \textit{Yogacintāmaṇi} and suggested by gamma one and delta one (\emph{jaṭharapravuddh°}).

In 1.27d, the compound \emph{daṇḍasthiratvaṃ} (`steadiness of the spine') is attested by all the important manuscript groups and testimonia, so it was likely original. However, the \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.27d) has \emph{candrasthiratvaṃ} (`steadiness of the moon'), and this reading is well-attested in many manuscripts that are lower on the stemma. Brahmānanda understands steadiness here as `the absence of flow' (\emph{sthiratvaṃ kṣaraṇābhāvaṃ}), a reference no doubt to the moon retaining its nectar.

The word \emph{tu} is often used to introduce a new posture, but in this case seems to be a verse filler.

In the first and third verse quarters, Svātmārāma may have rewritten \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} 3.96 to include the information that it was Śiva (\emph{śivena}) who taught the eighty-four \emph{āsana}s, whereas in the source Śiva is himself speaking. By doing this, Svātmārāma changes the meaning of the second half of the verse, as the \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} states that Śiva picked out the four best postures and taught them, whereas in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} it reads as though Svātmārāma himself is responsible for picking out the four best postures and teaching them. There are other instances in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} where Svātmārāma borrows a verse with a first person verb (e.g., 3.43, 4.2). However, in this instance, he may have intended to indicate that he chose the four postures coming after this verse (i.e., \emph{siddha}, \emph{padma}, \emph{siṃha} and \emph{bhadra}) because the \emph{Śivasaṃhitā} follows 3.96 with teachings on the postures called \emph{siddha}, \emph{padma}, \emph{paścimottāna} and \emph{svastika}. Another possibility is that Svātmārāma borrowed 1.33–1.34 from an unknown source that contained a dialogue that was different to that of \emph{Śivasaṃhitā}, as indicated by \emph{sakhe} in 1.34.

It is likely that the original version of this verse contained the vocative with the imperative form of the verb (\emph{sakhe tiṣṭha}). There are other instances where Svātmārāma included a verse with the vocative (e.g., 4.10, 4.12, 4.20, 4.72, 4.86, 4.88) as though the text were a dialogue. Other versions of this verse are transmitted by some manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, in which the vocative and imperative verb have been removed. In these cases, the \emph{sukhe} and \emph{sukham} is difficult to construe because the context suggests that the intended meaning was that one should always sit in \emph{siddhāsana} (as opposed to the other three \emph{āsana}s), rather than the prescription to always sit in a comfortable \emph{siddhāsana}.

The second verse quarter has many variations in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} manuscripts, as well as the manuscripts of the sources and testimonia. \getsiglum{N3} of the alpha group has \emph{athaikam ekahṛdaye dhṛtvā} and most of the collated witnesses have \emph{athaikam eva hṛdaye dhṛtvā}. The repetition of \emph{eka} appears to be a dittographical error and \emph{hṛdaye} does not make sense without an object of \emph{dhṛtvā} (i.e., having held what on the chest?). In the adopted reading \emph{athaikam āsyahṛdaye dhṛtvā}, which is attested by eta one, the oldest dated manuscript, the compound \emph{āsyahṛdaye} can be understood with the gerund \emph{dhṛtvā} and \emph{ekam} in the sense of `having held the face and chest together.' This alludes to the practice of Jālandhara's lock, in which the chin is placed on the chest. This meaning is more clearly seen in the \emph{Jyotsnā}'s version of the second verse quarter, \emph{hṛdaye kṛtvā hanuṃ susthiram} (`having put the jaw formly on the chest'). The compound \emph{āsyahṛdaye} is supported by other manuscripts, such as \getsiglum{N10,P1,P6,J16} and the variants \emph{asyahṛdaye} and \emph{asyahṛdayaṃ} also occur (e.g., \getsiglum{J7,J12,A1,V4,V18,V16,P8,P9}). Another possible reading is \emph{ekahṛdayo}, which is not supported by manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} in the most important stemmatic groups but is in two other manuscripts (\getsiglum{J2,M1}), the six-chapter \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} and \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi}, which attributes this verse to an unkown work called the \emph{Pavanayogasaṅgraha}. In this case, \emph{ekahṛdayaḥ} would qualify the yogi as having a mind focused on one thing. The other well-attested reading, \emph{athaikaṃ eva niyataṃ}, was an attempt to fix the problem of \emph{hṛdaye} by replacing it with \emph{niyatam}, which must be read with \emph{meḍhre pādam athaikaṃ} (`having fixed one foot on the penis'). But \emph{niyatam} is redundant here because of \emph{vinyaset} in the first verse quarter.     \end{philcomm}

It is odd to have \emph{suṣumnām} as the object of the verb \emph{abhyaset}. This reading is well attested by manuscripts of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, as well as the verse cited in the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi}, which attributes it to the \emph{Yogasāramañjarī}. Perhaps, the second hemistich was added somewhat haphazardly by Svātmārāma, and then others have tried to make sense of it by changing \emph{suṣumnām iva nāḍiṣu} to \emph{nāḍīnāṃ malaśodhanam}, which occurs in the \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.39). The reading \emph{nāḍīnāṃ malaśodhanam/e} is probably a patch as no other texts say that \emph{siddhāsana} clears the channels. However, the idea of purifying the channels can be found in other contexts (e.g., \emph{Kumbhakapaddhati} 120) and may hark back to an earlier notion of flushing (\emph{cālana}) the channels (e.g., \emph{Amṛtasiddhi} 11.6).

%Both \emph{uttabhya} and \emph{uttambhya} are well attested

%\emph{vakṣasyāsthāpya} is a marmasthāna

The main problem with this passage is the incomplete syntax of verse 1.46, which describes the position of the eyes, tongue, chin and chest in lotus pose. The words `the breath gradually' (\emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ}) are left hanging. The evidence of the source text, the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra}, is important here because it includes a verse that makes sense of \emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ}. The verse that completes the syntax is missing in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, perhaps because of a scribal error that happened early in the transmission. As seen in the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} verses 36 and 37 both end with \emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ}, the repetition of which likely caused an eyeskip.

\begin{versinnote}

\tl{idaṃ padmāsanaṃ proktaṃ sarvavyādhivināśanam |\\!}
\end{versinnote}

The manuscript readings with \emph{vakṣa sthāpayet} (\getsiglum{J7,V3,J8,J10,J17,N17}) or something similar (\getsiglum{V1,W4}) do not offer a solution to the incomplete syntax nor indicate that Svātmārāma rewrote \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 36 so that he could omit \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 37. For, apart from the possibility of an eyeskip, it is also conceivable that Svātmārāma intended to quote only the two verses of the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} (35–36) that describe the physical posture of \emph{padmāsana} and omit the next verse (37) that made sense of \emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ} because it was not relevant to the posture itself. Be this as it may, in the absence of evidence that Svātmārāma included \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 37 or wrote a coherent version of \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 1.46, we have tried to make sense of \emph{pavanaṃ śanaiḥ} by supplying the gerund \emph{samākṛṣya} in our translation. 

Brahmānanda's comment on the statement, `having raised the root of the uvula with the tongue' (\emph{rājadantamūlaṃ ca jihvayā uttabhya}) in 1.46 is worth noting. In the context of Haṭhayoga, one would assume this statement to be referring to a type of  \emph{khecarīmudrā}, in which the tongue lifts the root of the uvula, here called the `royal tooth' (\emph{rājadanta}, on the meaning of which see Mallinson 2007: 209 n. 258). However, Brahmānanda understands it differently (synonyms omitted for clarity): 
\begin{quote}
Supporting both roots of the front teeth on the left and right with the tongue [\ldots] — this fixation of the tongue has to be understood from the mouth of the teacher.

\emph{rājadantānāṃ daṃṣṭrāṇāṃ savyadakṣiṇabhāge sthitānāṃ mūle ubhe mūlasthāne jihvayā uttambhya ūrdhvaṃ stambhayitvā} | \emph{gurumukhād avagantavyo 'yaṃ jihvābandhaḥ} |
\end{quote}
Brahmānanda appears to have had in mind a probably older rule for meditation postures, according to which the tongue rests near the front teeth. One example of this is in \emph{Svacchandatantra}, which teaches a meditation pose called \emph{divyaṃ karaṇam} (4.365f.), in which the tongue is to rest at the tip
of the teeth (\emph{dantāgre jihvām ādāya}). Other Tantric texts have this or similar rules, in which the tongue is supposed to rest either on the teeth or the palate, early examples being the \emph{Mṛgendrāgama}, \textit{yogapāda} 19 (\emph{dantāgre jihvām ādāya}) and \emph{Mataṅgapārameśvaratantra}, \textit{yogapāda} 2.27 (\emph{tālumadhyagatenaiva jihvāgreṇa}).
Placing the tongue where it does not disturb the meditation seems quite appropriate for a `normal' meditative practice.\footnote{The rule of placing the tongue at the palate is also found in \emph{Iśānaśivapaddhati} 18.120: \emph{tāluke jihvāṃ saṃyojya kiñcidvivṛtavaktro dantair dantān asaṃspṛśan ṛjukāyaḥ}}

However, when the context is haṭhayogic physiology, we must assume that the aim is to reach the tongue back to the uvula, which is the source of `nectar.' Confusingly, yogic terminology includes many names for the uvula, and among these especially the term \emph{rājadanta} may give rise to confusion, since, as we have seen, the tongue might also in some yoga systems be placed at the front teeth.

Furthermore, \emph{khecarīmudrā} has been described in manifold ways. For example, the tenth-century \emph{Mokṣopāya} (V.55.14c) says that the tongue rests at the `source of the palate' (\emph{tālumūlatalālagnajihvā}) and the commentary, the
\emph{Saṃsārataraṇi}, on the parallel passage in \emph{Laghuyogavāsiṣṭha} V.6.155, which reads \emph{tālumūlāntarālagnajihvā°}, explains that this means that the tongue is to be placed in the middle of the two regions of the palate, and that this is the \emph{nabhomudrā}, alias `\emph{khecarī}' (\emph{tālumūlāntarālagnajihvamūlaḥ tālumūlayoḥ kākudamūladeśayoḥ āntare lagnam ālagnam jihvāmūlam yasyety anena nabhomudrā darśitā} | \emph{yā hi khecarı̄ty ucyate}).

A little later in the \emph{Mokṣopāya} (V.78.24ab) it is made clear that one should reach the uvula, `placed at the root of the palate' (\emph{tālumūlagatāṃ yatnāj jihvayākramya ghaṇṭikām}). In view of this background we must conclude that the author of the \emph{Jyotsnā} was probably not aware of the yogic meaning of \emph{rājadanta} and has tried his best to make sense of the passage,
echoing the idea of the two roots of the palate (although his text is not talking about the palate), but then wisely refers to the instruction of the teacher for practical details, probably noticing that his literal interpretation is somewhat opaque. In addition to his commentary on 1.46 (translated above), Brahmānanda’s comments on 3.22 (\emph{rājadantasthajihvāyām}) indicate that he thought the \emph{rājadanta} refers to the front teeth (\emph{kutaḥ}? \emph{yato dantānāṃ rājāno rājadantā rājadanteṣu tiṣṭhatīti rājadantasthāḥ, rājadantasthā cāsau jihvā ca tasyāṃ rājadantasthajihvāyāṃ bandhaḥ, taduparibhāgasya sambandhaḥ śastaḥ}).

In this context, the word \emph{durlabham} is somewhat ambiguous as to whether the posture is hard to perform or hard to acquire (the more usual meaning). In commenting on \emph{durlabham} in \emph{Jyotsnā} 2.74, Brahmānanda glosses it as \emph{duṣprāpam}, which means `difficult to attain' and `inaccessible.' 

The comment added to this verse by Svātmārāma indicates that he prefers the following version of \emph{padmāsana}, which derives from the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}, rather than the one he has borrowed from the \emph{Dattātreyayogāśāstra}.

%The reading of \emph{matsyamataṃ} in the subheading is unusual because elsewhere Matsyendra is not referred to as simply Matsya. Furthermore, this verse is from the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} (36), and the teachings of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} are attributed to Gorakṣa, not Matsyendra. However, in the extended recension of it known as the  \emph{Gorakṣaśataka},  \emph{Gorakṣasaṃhitā}, etc. the second verse includes homage to Mīna, i.e. Matsyendra.

The text at end of the second verse quarter is uncertain. Later witnesses, including Brahmānanda, have \emph{dhyāyaṃś ca} but none of the early ones has this reading. So, we have to take \emph{dhyānaṃ} with \emph{sannidhāya}. However, \emph{tat} is problematic because here it has no clear referent. In the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa, tat} appears to refer to the \emph{mokṣadvāra} broken by Kuṇḍalinī, which is mentioned in the previous verse. 

The two participles \emph{proccālayan} and \emph{muñcan} imply that the two things are happening at the same time, which is surprising but perhaps possible. Or one might infer that `and' (\emph{ca}) was supposed to be supplied and understand both actions as sequential.

%In the VM this verse comes in the passage on raising Kuṇḍalinī, so tat could refer to visualising K opening the mokṣadvāra.

It is not unusual to read \emph{pūrayan} with the locative as seen in this verse (cf. \emph{pūrayen mukhe} in \emph{Amaraugha} 21d). 

Gamma one's reading of \emph{niyatam} (instead of \emph{dhārayed}) in the third verse quarter explains the passive verbs in other witnesses. The passive verbs do not make sense with \emph{yas tu}. The passive verbs meaning to take in the breath (e.g., \emph{pīyate}) may have been adopted to remove the reference to holding the breath because a breath retention is not mentioned in the previous verse describing \emph{padmāsana} (only inhalation and exhalation). 

In the third verse quarter, the best alpha manuscript reads \emph{māruto mriyate yas tu}, which does not make sense. However, if one accepts \emph{pūrayet} in the second verse quarter, one could emend alpha's reading to \emph{māruto mriyate yasya}, which makes good sense (i.e., `the yogi whose breath dies is undoubtedly liberated'). In the same vein, J5 also has the plausible reading \emph{mārutaṃ mārayet yas tu}. 
%but J5 is contaminated (so the Gr3 reading dhārayet is more reliable).

%(MD: Or read \emph{pūrayan mārutaṃ dhriyate yas tu} ``he who remains by inhaling..."?
%This \emph{dhriyate} is rather intransitive than passive. 
%Cf. PW \emph{dhṛ} 22a ``fest sein, sich ruhig verhalten, stillhalten, verbleiben, sich erhalten, bestehen")

The \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.49) has \emph{naḍīdvāreṇa} instead of \emph{nāḍīdvāreṣu}, and Brahmānanda interprets it as the opening of the central channel (\emph{suṣumnāmārgeṇa}). This yields the idea of filling up the central channel (as opposed to other channels), which is described in the \emph{Yogabīja} (94–95).

Spreading the fingers and keeping the mouth open seem to be imitating the lion, and this is depicted in some iconography of yoganarasiṃha (for example, Yoga Narasimha, Vishnu's Man-Lion Incarnation, Samuel Eilenberg Collection, Bequest of Samuel Eilenberg, 1998, Accession Number: 2000.284.4. https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39251).  

The \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} attributes its citation of these verses on \emph{siṃhāsana} to the Yājñavalkya. Its citation does not include \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 1.52cd, which affirms that 1.52cd is not from the \emph{Yogayājñavalkya} (or \emph{Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā}). As far as we are aware, there is no source for the hemistich mentioning the three locks, so it may have been composed by Svātmārāma or borrowed from a lost work.

Manuscripts of two early groups, beta and gamma, as well as the \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.53), include an additional hemistich specifying that the left ankle is placed on the left side and the right ankle on the right (\emph{savyagulphaṃ tathā savye dakṣagulphaṃ tu dakṣiṇe}). This hemistich appears to have been added to make it clear that the ankles are not crossed in \emph{bhadrāsana}, unlike the previous pose, \emph{siṃhāsana}.

The second hemistich can be interpreted in different ways. One possibility is to understand \emph{nāḍiśuddhiṃ} as a bahuvrīhi qualifying \emph{mudrādipavanakriyām} in the sense that the yogi should practise a breathing technique, along with \emph{mudrā}s and other mechanisms, such as locks (\emph{bandha}), from which purification of the channels arise. Alternatively, one could separate \emph{mudrādi} from \emph{pavanakriyām} and understand three different techniques here, namely, the practice of purifying the channels (perhaps by the alternative nostril method mentioned at the beginning of the second chapter), the \emph{mudrā}s and the breathing techniques of \emph{prāṇāyāma}. The absence of a conjunctive particle, such as \emph{ca}, makes the second interpretation less likely. The version of this verse in the \emph{Yogacintāmaṇi} (cited in the testimonia) was changed to make it clear that \emph{nāḍiśuddhi} and \emph{pavanakriyā} with \emph{mudrā}s, are two distinct things.

1.55*1–2 are omitted from the alpha, gamma, delta and epsilon groups, so it is likely these verses were not in the earliest versions of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}. In fact, it is likely that both were added (perhaps initially as marginal notes) to elaborate on the word \emph{kriyā} in 1.55d. Both verses are similar to verses from the \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} (cited as the source). However, only the first half of \emph{Dattātreyayogaśāstra} 47 is given in these later versions of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, resulting in a near-nonsensical hemistich. Also, the syntax of 1.55.2ef is corrupt. One has to emend to \emph{deyā} to make sense of it. These verses (except 1.55.2ef) appear in the \emph{Jyotsnā} (1.65–66), but towards the end of chapter one.

Verse 1.55.3 is only found in manuscripts of the delta group. It is very difficult to find a reason why this verse should be inserted here. It is apparently a
\emph{muktaka} that would befit an accomplished spiritual poem more than an instructional manual, like the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, even here, in what appears as a sort of miscellaneous section at the end of a chapter. In this verse, the lyrical subject wonders about why the mind is still able to doubt, despite its insight into the nature of reality. The reader might wonder how this illusionist verse could be understood to fit our Yoga text. We can only speculate that perhaps the scribe of the hyparchetype of the delta manuscripts was fond of it.

The source is, as far as we can say, the \emph{Śāntiśataka} of the Kashmirian poet Sillana or Silhaṇa, The manuscripts of the \emph{Svātmopalabdhiśataka} give the name as \emph{Sillana}, the mostly Bengali manuscripts of the \emph{Śāntiśataka} read \emph{Śilhaṇa}, as does Aufrecht in his \emph{Catalogus Catalogorum}, 1891 (for further details see Hanneder, forthcoming). Sillana cannot be dated with any certainty but predates the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} by a few centuries. The
edition of the \emph{Śāntiśataka} – where a hundred original verses had to be identified – places the verse in question into an appendix of doubtful stanzas (see Karl Schönfeld: \emph{Das Śāntiśataka}. Leipzig: Harrassowitz 1910, p.\,90 [A9]). However, the editor did not provide a compelling reason to regard it as
unoriginal except only the fact that it is not transmitted in all manuscripts. What prevents further investigation of the matter is the lack of Kashmirian manuscripts for the \emph{Śāntiśataka} and its compilatory character: one quarter of the material is identical with Bhartṛhari's \emph{Vairāgyaśataka}. A still superficial glance at Sillana's \emph{Svātmopalabdhiśataka} gives the impression that our verse would fit there, but not so much in the \emph{Śāntiśataka}. Perhaps its first citation is in Advayavajra’s \emph{Tattva\-ratnāvalī} (24). While
these are only preliminary observations the verse is likely not original to the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}.

This verse was omitted from eta one, the oldest dated manuscript. The omission is probably deliberate as that manuscript does not have chapter four, which teaches \emph{nādānusandhāna}. The numbering in eta one suggests that its exemplar had this verse.

The term \emph{kumbhaka} is almost always masculine but appears in this verse as a neuter in the majority of manuscripts of the important groups.

%Marmasthāna: not clear whether to adopt \emph{citro} or \emph{citraṃ}, or V19’s \emph{mudrākhyaṃ karaṇaṃ tathā} or the others’ \emph{mudrādikaraṇāni ca}.

This verse is similar to 1.65, which has \emph{mudrādikaraṇāni ca}, so perhaps it was through confusion with 1.65 that the same reading is found in some witnesses of 1.56. It seems that the four auxiliaries (\emph{aṅga}) of Haṭhayoga are being referred to in the singular (hence \emph{āsanaṃ}), whereas in 1.65 the plural is used (i.e., \emph{pīṭhāni}). Therefore, the reading \emph{citraṃ} [...] \emph{karaṇaṃ tathā} is likely original for this verse.

%Yes, V19 reading probably best.

The readings \emph{tyāgī} and \emph{yogī} are both well attested in \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} 1.57b. The confusion between the two appears to have started early in the transmission of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}. The occurrence of \emph{tyāgī} in \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} 37 may be a dittographical type of mistake because the word \emph{tyāgī} is in the previous hemistich of that work. But it is more difficult to determine whether Svātmārāma used a manuscript of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa} with \emph{tyāgī} or \emph{yogī} in verse 37. Since the best alpha manuscript has \emph{yogī}, as well as eta one and many others, we have tentatively adopted it bearing in mind that it was changed early in the transmission of the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā}, most likely by a scribe who knew the reading of \emph{tyāgī} in a manuscript of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}.

This verse probably derives from the ‘original’ \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (12c–13b). It is also found, but reworked to be about the \emph{mitāhārī}, in Nowotny’s \emph{Gorakṣaśataka} (55), which is an extended recension of the \emph{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}. 

The idea of not eating the fourth portion of one’s food (\emph{caturthāṃśavivarjitaḥ}) can be found in older yoga texts, such as \emph{Dharmaputrikā} 1.51-52:

Cakra mentions as a variant: \emph{katvamlalavaṇakṣāra} (pungent, acid, saline and caustic). Cakra remarks that the term `hot' (\emph{uṣṇa}) denotes hot on touch when it occurs the first time, and hot with regard to potency when it occurs for the second time.

The compound \emph{°harītaśāka°} in 1.59a is spelt \emph{°haritaśāka°} in other works. The spelling \emph{°harīta} was probably adopted for metrical reasons. In some Nighaṇṭus (`thesauruses'), \emph{°haritaśāka°} is glossed as horseradish.

Brahmānanda’s understanding of \emph{harītaśāka} as \emph{pattraśāka} is probably wrong if \emph{pattraśāka} was intended as ‘leafy vegetables.’ But he may have used the term \emph{pattraśāka} in the sense of horseradish (\emph{śigru}) as the dictionary notes that \emph{pattraśāka} is probably equivalent to \emph{śākapattra}, which is mentioned in \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} 7.26 (above).

The term \emph{°sauvīra°} (1.59b) probably means sour gruel. Brahmānanda glosses  \emph{sauvīra} as \emph{kāñjika}, which is `fermented rice water.' On \emph{sauvīra}, Meulenbeld (1974: 516–517) says, `emph{sauvīra} is sour gruel made from barley and wheat.' The process of making it is described in the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} (1.44.35--40ab) as follows:

\begin{quote}
Roots of trivṛt etc., the first group (vidārigandhādi), mahat pañcamūla, mūrvā and śārṅgaṣṭā, and also of snuhī, haimavatī, triphalā, ativiṣā and vacā -- these are taken and divided into two parts out of which one is decocted and the other is powdered; now, crushed barley grains are impregnated with the above decoction several times, dried and then slightly fried. Taking three parts of this and one part of the above powder are put in a jar and mixed with their (of trivṛt, etc.) cold decoction and fermented properly. This is known as sauvīraka. (trans. Sharma 2018 (vol.1): 406)
\end{quote}

However, according to some Nighaṇṭus, \emph{sauvīra} can also mean stibnite (an ingredient in some añjana’s and medicines). For example, in the \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} (13.86):


\begin{versinnote}
\tl{añjanaṃ yāmunaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ nādeyaṃ mecakaṃ tathā\\+}
\tl{srotojaṃ dṛkpradaṃ nīlaṃ sauvīraṃ ca suvīrajam ||\\!}
\end{versinnote}

Note also that the \emph{Yogaprakāśikā} (1.53) takes \emph{sauvīra} with \emph{taila}, perhaps to solve the problem of \emph{taila} on its own (see below for more on this). The compound \emph{sauvīrataila} is explained as `oil produced in the place Suvīra' (\emph{suvīradeśodbhavatailam}). According to Ali (1966: 144), Suvīra is known as a country that was also called Suvira (V.79), Sauvira (XVI.21) and Sauvīraka (IV.23). He identifies it with the Rohri/Khairpur region of Sind. 
%( S.M. Ali, Geography of the Purānas, Delhi, 1966, p. 144).

The word \emph{taila} could refer to \emph{tilataila}. This is supported by the following rule (\emph{paribhāṣā}) in the \emph{Śārṅgadharasaṃhitā} (48):
\emph{anuktāvasthāyāṃ paribhāṣāvidhiḥ} [...] \emph{taile ’nukte tilodbhavam}. We thank Dominik Wujastyk for this reference.  

Our translation of \emph{madya} takes into account the following remarks of James McHugh (2021: 8):
% Mchugh, An Unholy Brew)
\begin{quote}
    The most general Sanskrit term to denote drinks that create a drunken state is \emph{madya} “intoxicating [drink].” Translating this word is hard. “Inebriating drink” is clumsy to my ear. “Intoxicating” contains the unfortunate “toxic” element that is not present in the Sanskrit word, though at least in English this is a common word, applicable to various substances and states and lacking any “toxic” associations in everyday usage.
\end{quote}

In the compound \emph{ājādimāṃsa}° (1.59c), the word \emph{āja}° is required for the metre. So, variants beginning with \emph{aja}° can be dismissed. Another well-attested reading is \emph{ājāvimāṃsa}°. Although this was probably read as `goat and sheep flesh,' \emph{āvi} is not attested as an adjective of sheep, so this reading was probably not original. Moreover, only \emph{ājādimāṃsa}° makes good sense. Diwakar Acharya believes that the prohibition of goat flesh and fish in this verse suggests it derives from the North East of India.

The term \emph{kulattha} is a kind of pulse, translated by Dominik Wujastyk (1998: 77) as `poor man's pulse.'
% Dominik Wujastyk, Roots of Ayurveda, Penguin Books, 1998.

The word \emph{kola} is a name for Zizyphus Jujuba (Nadkarni 1926: pp. 919--920). It is also known as \emph{badara}. This is how Brahmānanda understands it in \emph{Jyotsnā} 1.59 (\emph{kolaṃ kolyāḥ phalaṃ badaram}). According to Nadkarni, the fruit of the wild variety is very acid and astringent. It is believed to purify the blood and assist digestion. The bark is astringent and a simple remedy for diarrhoea. The root is useful as a decoction in fever and delirium. There are references to \emph{kola} being pungent, though this does not seem to indicate sufficiently why \emph{kola} is mentioned separately in the \emph{Haṭhapradīpikā} as an unwholesome food. Diwakar Acharya has informed us that \emph{kola} can refer to a type of banana in some parts of India.

According to Sharma (1982: 69), \emph{piṇyāka} is, ‘The remnant paste of oily seeds after pressing out the oil content is called \emph{piṇyāka}.’ Diwakar says it is an oil cake that has a strong flavour, which may account for its inclusion in this list of unwholesome foods.
% P.V. Sharma, Ḍalhaṇa and his commentary on drugs, 1982.

The term \emph{hiṅgu} is Asafoetida (Nadkarni 1926: 360–361). As to why it might be considered unwholesome, the following comments by Nadkarni give some indication:
\begin{quote}
If long continued, even in moderate doses, it gives rise to alliaceous eructations, acrid irritation in the throat, flatulence, diarrhoea and burning in the urine.
\end{quote}

%\emph{laśuna} = garlic (Nadkarni 1926: 45).

We have not found any conclusive evidence for the meaning of \emph{tilapiṇḍa}. Brahmānanda glosses it as \emph{piṇyāka} (on the meaning of which see the notes for the previous verse).

The meaning of the compound \emph{kadaśanaśākotkaṭaṃ} is not clear. Brahmānanda understands it as a list (\emph{dvandva}) consisting of \emph{kadaśana}, \emph{śāka} and \emph{utkaṭa}, which he defines as bad food, prohibited vegetables and pepper, respectively.

There are various possible meanings of \emph{utkaṭa}. According to some Nighaṇṭus, the word \emph{utkaṭā} can mean pepper  (e.g., \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} 5.16 \emph{pārvatī śailajā tāmrā lambabījā tathotkaṭā}) and, according to the dictionary (s.v. Monier Williams), \emph{utkaṭa} can refer to Saccharum Sara and \emph{utkaṭā} also to Laurus Cassia (cinnamon). 

However, \emph{utkaṭa} can be an adjective that means ‘abounding in’ at the end of a compound. Since this verse consists of many adjectives describing food that is unwholesome, it is likely that \emph{kadaśanaśākotkaṭaṃ} was intended as an adjectival \emph{tatpuruṣa}, in which case it means ‘[food] full of vegetables' \emph{śākotkaṭa} that are `bad food' or perhaps, `bad eating' \emph{kadaśana} in the sense of hard to chew.

In 1.62b, \emph{maṇḍa}, which is supported by alpha, beta and gamma, is more likely than \emph{khaṇḍa} (`candied sugar') because fits the context of diary products mentioned in this compound (i.e., \emph{kṣīra, ājya} and \emph{navanīta}). The term \emph{navanīta} is discussed in \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā, sūtrasthāna,} 45.92 as follows:
\begin{quote}
Fresh butter (\emph{navanīta}) is light soft, sweet, astringent, slightly sour, cold, intellect-promoting, appetiser, cordial, checking, aphrodisiac, non-burning, pacifies pitta and vāta and alleviates wasting, cough, wound, consumption, piles and facial paralysis [...] (trans. Sharma 2018 vol. 1: 434)
\end{quote}

The word \emph{sitā} is one of many words for ground sugar. Meulenbeld (1974: 507) comments that \emph{sitā} is `very white and looks like gravel.'

Thw term \emph{paṭola} can refer to at least two different gourds. Meulenbeld (1974: 569) compiled a list of six possibilities, including \textsc{Trichosanthes dioica} \textsc{Roxb}. (`pointed gourd'), \textsc{Trichosanthes cucumerina} \textsc{Linn} (`snake gourd').

Nadkarni (1954: 863, 518) has two entries on \emph{paṭola}:
%Nadkarni, A. K. (1954). Dr. K. M. Nadkarni’s Indian Materia Medica, with Ayurvedic, Unani-tibbi, Siddha, Allopathic, Homeopathic, Naturopathic & Home Remedies, Appendices & Notes. 2 vols. Bombay: Popular Prakashan. url: https: //archive.org/details/IndianMateriaMedicaK.M.Nadkarni (on 11 Aug. 2017). URL is 1926 edition.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Snake gourd is common in Bengal and cultivated in Northern India and Punjab. The unripe fruit of this climbing plant is generally used as a culinary vegetable and is very wholesome, specially suited for the convalescent.

\item Smooth luffa is a hairy climbing herb extensively cultivated in several parts of India. The fruit is edible. Medicinally it is described as `cool, costive, demulcent, producive of loss of appetite and excitive of wind, bile and phlegm.
\end{enumerate}
Sharma (1982: 156) adds that \emph{paṭola} is a synonym of \emph{kulaka} and is well known as \textsc{Trichosanthas dioica Roxb.} Brahmānanda glosses \emph{paṭola} as \emph{kośātakī}, which is \textsc{Luffa acutangula Roxb} (Meulenbeld 1974: 586), suggesting that he thought it was some sort of luffa. He also mentions the vernacular term \emph{paravara} for \emph{paṭola}.

Groups of five vegetables (\emph{pañcaśāka} or \emph{śākapañcaka}) have been defined in various yoga texts, but such grouping of vegetables does not seem to occur outside of literature on yoga. The earilest reference to a group of five vegetables known to us is the sixteenth-century \emph{Yuktabhavadeva} 4.22, which attributes the verse to the \emph{Śivayoga}. The same verse is also quoted in \emph{Jyotsnā} 1.65 with attribution to a medical source (\emph{vaidyaka}):

\begin{quote}
\begin{versinnote}
\tl{sarvaśākam acākṣuṣyaṃ cākṣuṣyaṃ śākapañcakam |\\+}
\tl{jīvantī vāstumatsyākṣī meghanādaḥ punarnavāḥ || iti ||\\!}
\end{versinnote}
\end{quote}
Another verse on a similar fivefold group of vegetables is also cited in the \emph{Haṭhatattvakaumudī} (4.26)
\begin{quote}
\begin{versinnote}
\tl{pañcaśākas tu–\\+}
\tl{kṣīraparṇī ca jīvantī matsyākṣī ca punarnavā\\+}
\tl{meghanādaś ceti budhaiḥ pañcaśākaḥ prakīrtitaḥ || iti ||\\!}
\end{versinnote}
\end{quote}
And a group with more significant differences is mentioned in the \emph{Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā} (5.20).
\begin{quote}
\begin{versinnote}
\tl{bālaśākaṃ kālaśākaṃ tathā paṭolapatrakam |\\+}

\end{versinnote}
\end{quote}

It is not entirely clear how one should understand \emph{divya} (1.62d). Brahmānanda glosses it with \emph{nirdoṣa} (`defectless') and takes it with \emph{udaka}. Ayurvedic sources indicate more clearly that \emph{divyodaka} was understood as rainwater. In a section on types of water (\emph{jalavarga}) in the \emph{Sūtrasthāna} of the \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} (27.196–224), rainwater is referred to as `\emph{divyaṃ udaka}' (1.27.198) in a discussion of the properties of water that has fallen from the sky. The compound \emph{divyodaka} is used in other Āyurvedic works to refer to the use of rainwater in recipes and treatments  (e.g., \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya} 8.42–43). Also, the \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} (14.4) glosses \emph{divyodaka} as rainwater:
\begin{quote}
