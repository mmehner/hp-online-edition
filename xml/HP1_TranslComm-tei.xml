<chapter>Translation &amp; philological commentary</chapter>  <note type="translation" target="#hp01_001"> Homage to the glorious Ādinātha by whom the system of Haṭhayoga was taught. It shines forth like a ladder for one desirous of climbing to the lofty terrace of the royal palace. </note>
 <note type="testimonia" target="#hp01_001"> Cf. Yogasārasaṃgraha, p. 54. 
<lg>
 <l>sadādināthāya namo’stu tubhyaṃ yenopadiṣṭā haṭhayogavidyā |</l>

 Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā 1.1 ādīśvarāya praṇamāmi tasmai yenopadiṣṭā haṭhayogavidyā |  virājate pronnatarājayogam āroḍhum icchor adhirohiṇīva || </note>
 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_001"> The reading <hi>rājasaudha</hi> is preferable for poetical reasons, as explained in Hanneder 2020, p. 128–130. Also, the <hi>Jyotsnā</hi> explains that the <hi>alaṃkāra</hi> here is a comparison (<hi>upamā</hi>), which consists of four elements: (1) a particle expressing the comparison (<hi>iva</hi>), (2) the object compared (<hi>upameya</hi>), i.e., the <hi>haṭhayogavidyā</hi> leading to Rājayoga (<hi>rājayogaprāpikā</hi>), (3) the property compared, that is, effortlessness (<hi>anāyāsena</hi>) and, most importantly, (4) an image to compare with, which in this case is <hi>rājasaudha</hi>. This idea is confirmed by Brahmānanda, when he sums up and completes the poetical details as: <hi>yathā pronnatasaudham āroḍhum icchor adhirohiṇy anāyāsena saudhaprāpikā bhavati evaṃ haṭhadīpikāpi pronnatarājayogam āroḍhum icchor anāyāsena rājayogaprāpikā bhavatīti upamālaṅkāraḥ</hi>. The Sanskrit poeticians explain that when some elements of a comparison remains unexpressed we get an incomplete (<hi>lupta</hi>) comparison. Often words like <hi>iva</hi> or <hi>yathā</hi> are missing or the common property, but if we read <hi>rājayoga</hi> we lose the <hi>upamāna</hi> (i.e., <hi>rājasaudha</hi>). One part of the comparison should not be missing. But from the perspective of <hi>alaṃkāraśāstra</hi> the verse has a problem that has surely caused the dilemma: it either leaves the <hi>upameya</hi> or the <hi>upamāna</hi> incomplete. Brahmānanda has mentioned both <hi>yathā adhirohiṇī saudhaprāpikā bhavati evaṃ haṭhadīpikā rājayogaprāpikā bhavati</hi>, but had to supply <hi>rājasaudha</hi>, while his text reads <hi>rājayoga</hi>. But to have the <hi>upameya</hi> in the text is odd. Even Brahmānanda could only know of the image (<hi>rājasaudha</hi>) from the alternative reading he did not accept. However, it seems likely that the author would have included the <hi>upamāna</hi> in the text, as in our critical text, so that the reader would know that the upper terrace of the palace is an image for <hi>rājayoga</hi>. It is further likely that the substitution of <hi>rājayoga</hi> for <hi>rājasaudha</hi> was the result of the tendency to insert the word <hi>yoga</hi> in the opening verses of the text wherever possible, even where it does not fit, as can be seen in 1.2d (<hi>haṭhayogopadiśyate</hi>) and 1.3b (<hi>rājayogam ajānatām</hi>). In the latter case the poetical image has also been lost. The metre of 1.1 is Indravajrā </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_002"> Having bowed to the glorious guru, the Lord, the yogi Svātmārāma has taught the system of Haṭhayoga solely for [attaining] Rājayoga. </note>
 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_002"> The reading <hi>yogopadiśyate</hi> (J7,J10,N17,W4, etc.) is only possible if one accepts that double <hi>sandhi</hi> is a feature of the style of composition, which it is not. Moreover, this reading appears to have resulted from an attempt to replace the word <hi>vidyā</hi> with <hi>yoga</hi> in the opening verses of the text. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_003"> The compassionate Svātmārāma holds the Lamp on Haṭha for those who are ignorant of the royal path because of wandering in the darkness of many opinions. </note>
 <note type="testimonia" target="#hp01_003"> Haṭharatnāvalī 1.4 bhrāntyā bahumatadhvānte rājayogam ajānatām | kevalaṃ rājayogāya haṭhavidyopadiśyate || </note>
 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_003"> Most witnesses have <hi>rājayogam ajānatām</hi> (`for those ignorant of Rājayoga’) in 1.3b. While this reading is well attested by the manuscripts transmission of the <hi>Haṭhapradīpikā</hi> and some manuscripts of the <hi>Haṭharatnāvalī</hi> (note that P,T,t1 of the critical edition [Gharote 2009: 5 n. 2] have <hi>rājamārgam ajānataḥ</hi>), the reading of a royal path (<hi>rājamārgam</hi>) is consistent with the metaphor of people wandering from a path in the darkness and, therefore, most probably authorial. In 1.1d both <hi>kṛpākaraḥ</hi> and <hi>kṣamākaraḥ</hi> are attested. The former is preserved by the V1 and group 2 whereas the latter by some manuscripts of the delta group. Since the context is the author helping yogis who have strayed from the royal path, <hi>kṛpākara</hi> makes better sense. As Brahmānanda notes, this compound can be understood as one who is compassionate (<hi>kṛpā</hi> + <hi>kara</hi>) or one who is a mine (i.e., a rich source) of compassion (<hi>kṛpā</hi> + <hi>ākara</hi>). In the Devanagari transmission, the <hi>kṣa</hi> of <hi>kṣamākaraḥ</hi> may have arisen as a mistake for <hi>kṛ</hi>. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_004"> In fact, Matsyendra, Gorakṣa and other [perfected yogis] knew the system of Haṭha, and the yogi Svātmārāma knows it owing to their favour. </note>
 <note type="testimonia" target="#hp01_004"> Post 15th Century Haṭharatnāvali 1.3 haṭhavidyāṃ hi gorakṣamatsyendrādyā vijānate | ātmārāmo ’pi jānīte śrīnivāsas tathā svayam || </note>
 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_004"> The word <hi>athavā</hi> (‘or’) is difficult to construe here. Brahmānanda understands it as conjunction (<hi>athavāśabdaḥ samuccaye</hi>), and this is how we have interpreted it. The variant <hi>mahāyogī</hi> in group 4c (G5, J4, J11, Ko, P15) avoids this difficulty, but is probably an attempt to remove the difficulty of understanding <hi>athavā</hi>. One could emend to <hi>tathā</hi> but this would be a bold intervention given the weight of evidence supporting <hi>’thavā</hi>. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_006"> Many manuscripts preserve the reading <hi>pauraṇṭaka</hi>. We have accepted <hi>koraṇṭaka</hi> because this name is associated with the <hi>Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati</hi>. This reading is well attested by various manuscripts of the <hi>Haṭhapradīpikā</hi>, including those of group 2, as well as those of the <hi>Haṭharatnāvalī</hi> (Gharote 2009: 35 n. 3), which also attest <hi>gonandaka</hi>. Also, <hi>Goraṇṭakuḍu</hi> is the name of a disciple of Gorakṣanātha in the <hi>Navanāthacaritramu</hi> (Jones 2017:194 n.3). The compound <hi>siddhapāda</hi> could be a respectful affix. However, it seems unlikely here because it would cross the <hi>pāda</hi> break. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_007"> It is possible that <hi>pūjyapāda</hi> could be a respectful affix to the name Kāṇerī. The variant <hi>dhvaninātha</hi> may have resulted from a transposition of the first two syllables of <hi>nityanātha</hi>. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_008"> Allamaprabhudeva, Ghoḍācolī, Ṭiṇṭiṇī, Bhālukī and Nāgabodha and Khaṇḍakāpālika. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_008"> The name Allamaprabhudeva (sometimes Allama Prabhu Deva or Allama Prabhudeva in secondary literaure) is largely transmitted as allamaḥ prabhudevaḥ, as though it were two names, although some manuscripts of the <hi>Haṭhapradīpikā</hi> have <hi>allamaprabhudevaś ca</hi> (i.e., Tue,V3,V8,V13,V16,V22,Vu,N24,N26) and so do some of the <hi>Haṭharatnāvalī</hi> (i.e., P,T,t1 in Gharote 2009: 35 n. 8). The names Nāgabodha, Nāgabodhi, Naradeva, Nāgadeva all seem possible in 1.8c. Many witnesses have khaṇḍa and kāpālika as separate names. However, khaṇḍakāpālika is well attested. Examples include <hi>Kathāsaritsāgara</hi> 121.5 ff. (check), <hi>Bṛhatkathāmañjarī</hi> 10.45 (check) and Vajrapāṇi’s <hi>Laghutantraṭīkā</hi>, p.45 (<hi>vīrāḥ khaṇḍakāpālikādayaś caturviṃśatiḥ</hi>). It may be a derogatory name for a Kāpālika, coined perhaps by an outsider and connoting something like a defective Kāpālika in the sense of a `part time’ Kāpālika. Alternatively, it could simply refer to one who used a broken skull as a bowl. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_009"> Having destroyed the rod of death through the power of Haṭhayoga, these great perfected yogis and others wander in the world. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_009"> The reference to <hi>brahmāṇḍa</hi> (‘the world’) implies liberation in life (<hi>jīvanmukti</hi>) and physical immortality. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_010"> Haṭha is considered a refuge for those who are burnt by the scorching torment of transmigration. Haṭha is the tortoise that supports the worlds of all yogas. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_010"> The compound <hi>saṃsāratāpa</hi> is well attested and found elsewhere (e.g., <hi>Viṣṇupurāṇa</hi> 6.7.62, <hi>Agnipurāṇa</hi> 371.1, <hi>Haṭhatattvakaumudī</hi> 38.92, emph{Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati} ms. 46/440, f. 1v). The reading of <hi>samāśrayo</hi> in V1 is metrically faulty. The accepted reading <hi>āśrayo [’]yam</hi> is better metically and well attested. N23 preserves the reading <hi>samāśrayamaṭho haṭhaḥ</hi> (similar to the <hi>Yogasārasaṃgraha</hi>), which is similar to the fourth <hi>pāda</hi>. Though this reading is possible, it seems more likely that it came about through dittography. The word <hi>jagatāṃ</hi> is probably authorial because it makes good sense with <hi>ādhārakamaṭha</hi> in light of the cosmological notion that the tortoise supports all the worlds. However, this reading may not have been understood by some and was changed in the vulgate and other witnesses to <hi>yuktānāṃ</hi> instead. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_011"> The doctrine of Haṭha should be kept completely secret by those yogis who are desiring success. When it is secret it becomes potent. However, when it has been revealed, it becomes impotent. </note>

This hemistich derives from the <hi>Gorakṣaśataka</hi> (32cd), which has <hi>paryante</hi> instead of <hi>paryantaṃ</hi>. It stipulates that the hut should be built in a place measuring up to a bow length and free from rocks, fire and water. None of the early manuscripts have this hemistich which suggests that it was added at a later time. Nonetheless, it appears in over a dozen manuscripts that were consulted for this edition. These manuscripts are not close to an early hyparchetype of the text. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_013"> The syntax of this verse is rather problematic. One would expect the features of the hut, which are listed in the first three pādas of the verse, to be in the nominative case, with the words <hi>idaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ</hi> in the fourth pāda referring back to them. However, the compounds in the first three pādas appear to qualify <hi>lakṣaṇa</hi> as though they were adjectives, and this appears to have been the way the verse was composed. The manuscripts preserve many different readings at the end of the compound beginning with <hi>arandhragarta</hi>. The reading <hi>piṭharaṃ</hi> has been suggested by Dominic Goodall, who understands it as potsherds (ask ref from Dominic?). The sense is that the hut should be free of rubbish, such as potsherds. One would expect a word for a defect in a hut that is similar to, but not the same as, cracks (<hi>randhra</hi>) and holes (<hi>garta</hi>). For this reason, the reading <hi>vivaraṃ</hi> looks like a patch, as its meaning does not add anything to <hi>randhragarta</hi>. The reading <hi>viṭapaṃ</hi> is well attested among the witnesses of the <hi>Haṭhapradīpikā</hi> and <hi>Haṭharatnāvalī</hi>. However, it is difficult to construe in this context unless it was intended to refer to creepers or branches that might invade or encroach upon the hut. Nearly all the early mss. have <hi>bādhojjitaṃ</hi>, whereas the Yogacintāmaṇi and V19 have the more easily understood reading of <hi>jantūjjhitaṃ</hi> (‘free from creatures’). However, <hi>bādhojjitaṃ</hi> may have been original because it is so well attested and a hut is described similarly in <hi>Suśrutasaṃhitā</hi> 6.17.67 (<hi>gṛhe nirābādhe</hi>). </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_015"> It is impossible to be certain about the meaning of <hi>niyamagraha</hi>, as the manuscripts do not indicate whether an <hi>avagraha</hi> (i.e., <hi>prajalpo ’niyamagraha</hi>) was intended. Although <hi>yama</hi> and <hi>niyama</hi> are not included in the <hi>Haṭhapradīpikā</hi> as auxiliaries of Haṭhayoga, verse 2.14 implies that <hi>niyama</hi> is necessary at least in the early stages of establishing a practice. Furthermore, verse 3.82 suggests that a yogi who does not practice <hi>niyama</hi> might obtain success in yoga through the practice of <hi rend="italic">vajroli</hi>. Ambiguity over the role of <hi>yama</hi> and <hi>niyama</hi> in Haṭhayoga appears to have prompted some to insert verses on ten <hi>yama</hi>s and ten <hi>niyama</hi>s after the next verse (1.16). The additional verses may derive from the <hi>Śāradātilakatantra</hi> (25.7–8) or the <hi>Vasiṣṭhasaṃhitā</hi> (1.38, 1.53). In the <hi>Jyotsnā</hi>, Brahmānanda reads <hi>niyamāgraha</hi> and takes it as though <hi>āgraha</hi> was implied, which yields the meaning of ‘over insistence on rules’, and he relates it to extreme ascetic practice. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_016"> For the second <hi>pāda</hi>, the north Indian manuscripts have something along the lines of <hi>tattvajñānāc ca darśanāt</hi>. The problem with this reading is the meaning of <hi>darśana</hi> by itself (i.e., discernment of what?). The early sources of this verse, in particular the <hi>Śivadharmottara</hi>, indicate that the second pāda read as <hi>santoṣāt tattvadarśanāt</hi>, which makes much better sense of the word <hi>darśana</hi> (i.e., ‘seeing the truth’). It seems that this reading may have been adopted by Svātmārāma because the word <hi>santoṣāt</hi> is present in the south Indian manuscripts. At some point in the transmission, <hi>tattvadarśanāt</hi> became <hi>tattvajñānāt</hi> and <hi>santoṣāt</hi> was dropped. The word <hi>darśanāt</hi> was changed to <hi>viniścayāt</hi> in V19 and the <hi>Yogacintāmaṇi</hi>, which indicates that we are not alone in questioning its meaning. The problem with <hi>viniścayāt</hi> in <hi>pāda</hi> two is that <hi>niścayāt</hi> is widely attested in <hi>pāda</hi> one. It should also be noted that the word <hi>tattva</hi> could have a more specific meaning in the <hi>Haṭhapradīpikā</hi> (4.3) as Svātmārāma states that it is a synonym of <hi>samādhi</hi>. In other yoga texts, it can sometimes refer to the practices of yoga (e.g., <hi>tritattva</hi> in <hi>Amṛtasiddhi</hi> 13.12, 14.2  3). </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_017"> The reading of <hi>aṅgapāṭavam</hi> is attested among most of the early manuscripts. Although this compound rarely appears in other yoga texts, a similar term <hi>śarīrapāṭava</hi> occurs in the <hi>Śivasaṃhitā</hi> (2.35) as one of the benefits bestowed by digestive fire (<hi>vaiśvānarāgni</hi>), which indicates that the word <hi>pāṭava</hi> was used in relation to the body and the benefits of yoga. The compound <hi>aṅgapāṭava</hi> seems to imply the optimal functioning of the body. However, the alternative reading, <hi>aṅgalāghava</hi> (‘lightness of the limbs’ or ‘dexterity’) is more common in yoga texts, even in works known to Svātmārāma, such as the <hi>Dattātreyayogaśāstra</hi> (<hi>śarīralaghutā</hi>) and the <hi rend="italic">Amanaska</hi> ([...] <hi>laghutvaṃ ca śarīrasyopajāyate</hi>). Therefore, it is likely that the less common term <hi>aṅgapāṭavam</hi> was changed to the more widely used notion of <hi>aṅgalāghava</hi>, perhaps early on in the transmission, as the latter is attested by group two (i.e., N23, V19, etc.) </note>

The evidence of the DYŚ is important here. The statement ending with <hi>pavanaṃ śanaiḥ</hi> is left hanging, perhaps, because of an eyeskip that happened early in the transmission.

Instead, it seems that he quoted these two verses (1.45–46) from the Dattātreyayogaśāstra and simply omitted the next verse that made sense of <hi>pavanaṃ śanaiḥ</hi> because it was not relevant to the posture itself. [JH] The background of the passage <hi>rājadantamūlaṃ ca jihvayā uttambhya</hi> in 1.46 is more complex than it may appear. Here it is a literal quotation from the DYŚ, but many other Haṭhayogic texts teach a particular position of the tongue, in which it is in one or the other way turned back in the direction of the uvula, as we read explicitly in the <hi>Vivekamārtāṇḍa</hi> (REF): <hi>kapālakuhare jihvā praviṣṭā viparītagā</hi>. Brief references to this practice can become ambiguous for various reasons, and this has possibly confused Brahmānanda. One reason is that there is a, probably older, rule for meditation postures according to which the tongue rests near the teeth. One instance would be <hi>Svacchandatantra</hi>, which teaches a meditation pose called <hi>divyaṃ karaṇam</hi> (4.365f.), in which the tongue is to rest at the tip of the teeth (<hi>dantāgre jihvām ādāya</hi>). Other Tantric texts have this or similar rules, in which the tongue is supposed to rest either on the teeth or the palate,<note place="bottom">This rule is found in <hi>Iśānaśivapaddhati</hi>: <hi>tāluke jihvāṃ saṃyojya kiñcidvivṛtavaktro dantair dantān asaṃspṛśan ṛjukāyaḥ</hi>. REF</note>
 the earliest instance being perhaps <hi>Mrgendrāgama</hi> ?.18. Placing the tongue where it does not disturb the meditation seems quite appropriate for a ``normal’’ meditative practice. [Jason: There’s also a clear reference to the tip of the tongue being placed in the middle of the palate in 2.27 of the Yogapāda of the Mataṅgapārameśvaratantra (tālumadhyagatenaiva jihvāgreṇa mahāmune). In fact, in works that predate Haṭhayoga (i.e., 11th c.), the most common instruction is to put the tip of the tongue on the palate (tālu).] We might try to interpret the passage in this manner, however, once Haṭhayogic physiology is at the background, we must assume that the aim is to reach back to the uvula, to the source of the "nectar". For the background and for the crucial references see Mallinson’s note on <hi>Khecarīvidyā</hi> 1.65ab.<note place="bottom">p. 209.</note>
 Confusingly Yogic terminology has used and possibly invented new names for uvula, and among these especially the term <hi>rājadanta</hi> may give rise to confusion, since, as we have seen, the tongue might also in some Yoga systems be placed at the (front) teeth. Furthermore the details in these descriptions of the <hi>khecarīmudrā</hi> are manifold. The 10th century <hi>Mokṣopāya</hi> says that the tongue rests at the ``source of the palate’’<note place="bottom"><hi>tālumūlatalālagnajihvā</hi> MU V.55.14c.</note>
 and the commentary <hi>Saṃsārataraṇi</hi> on the parallel passage in <hi>Laghuyogavāsiṣṭha</hi> V.6.155, which reads <hi>tālumūlāntarālagnajihva </hi>, explains that this means that the tongue is to be placed in the middle of the two regions of the palate, and that this is the <hi>nabhomudrā</hi>, alias ``<hi>khecarī</hi>’’.<note place="bottom"><hi>tālumūlāntarālagnajihvamūlah. tālumūlayoh. kākudamūladeśayoh. āntare lagnam ālagnam jihvāmūlam yasyety anena nabhomudrā darśitā | yā hi khecarı̄ty ucyate.</hi></note>
 A little later in the <hi>Mokṣopāya</hi> it is made clear that one should reach the uvula, ``placed a the root of the palate’’.<note place="bottom"><hi>tālumūlagatāṃ yatnāj jihvayākramya ghaṇṭikām</hi> (V.78.24ab)</note>
 In view of this background we must conclude that the author of the <hi>Jyotsnā</hi> was probably not aware of the Yogic meaning of <hi>rājadanta</hi> and has tried his best to make sense of the passage, echoing the idea of the two roots of the palate (although his text is not talking about the palate), but then wisely refers to the instruction of the teacher for practical details, probably noticing that his literal interpretation is somewhat opaque (I omit the synonyms for clarity): <quote>Pressing both roots of the front teeth on the left and right with the tongue [ldots ] — this fixation of the tongue has to be understood from the mouth of the teacher. <hi>rājadantānāṃ daṃṣṭrāṇāṃ savyadakṣiṇabhāge sthitānāṃ mūle ubhe mūlasthāne jihvayā uttambhya ūrdhvaṃ stambhayitvā | guru mukhād avagantavyo ’yaṃ jihvā bandhaḥ |</hi></quote> [Jason: also, Brahmānanda’s comments on 3.22 indicate that he thought rājadanta refers to the front teeth. When commenting on rājadantasthajihvāyāṃ, he says kutaḥ ? yato dantānāṃ rājāno rājadantā rājadanteṣu tiṣṭhatīti rājadantasthāḥ, rājadantasthā cāsau jihvā ca tasyāṃ rājadantasthajihvāyāṃ bandhaḥ, taduparibhāgasya sambandhaḥ śastaḥ]. </note>

 <note type="philcomm" target="#hp01_048"> The reading of <hi>matsyamataṃ</hi> in the subheading is unusual because elsewhere Matsyendra is not referred to as simply Matsya. Furthermore, this verse is from the <hi>Vivekamārtaṇḍa</hi> (36), and the teachings of the <hi>Vivekamārtaṇḍa</hi> are attributed to Gorakṣa, not Matsyendra. However, in the extended recension of it known as the <hi>Gorakṣaśataka</hi>, <hi>Gorakṣasaṃhitā</hi>, etc. the second verse includes homage to Mīna, i.e. Matsyendra. The end of pāda b is uncertain.

However, <hi>tat</hi> is problematic because here it has no clear referent. In the <hi>Vivekamārtaṇḍa tat</hi> appears to refer to the <hi>mokṣadvāra</hi> broken by Kuṇḍalinī, which is mentioned in the previous verse. The two participles <hi>proccālayan</hi> and <hi>muñcan</hi> imply that the two things are happening at the same time, which is surprising but perhaps possible. Or perhaps one can understand them as sequential. In the VM this verse comes in the passage on raising Kuṇḍalinī, so tat could refer to visualising K opening the mokṣadvāra. </note>

 but the editor saw no compelling reason not to regard it as original except through the fact that it is not transmitted in all manuscripts. What prevents further investigation of the matter is the lack of Kashmirian mss. for the <hi>Śāntiśataka</hi> and its compilatory character: one quarter of the material is identical with Bhartṛhari’s <hi>Vairāgyaśataka</hi>. A still superficial glance at Sillana’s <hi>Svātmopalabdhiśataka</hi> gives the impression that our verse would fit there, but not so much in the <hi>Śāntiśataka</hi>. Perhaps its first citation is in Advayavajra’s <hi>Tattva ratnāvalī</hi> (ref??), While these are only preliminary observations the verse is probably not original in any stage of development of the HYP, but limited to V19 (and N17). </note>

Brahmānanda: <hi>sauvīra</hi> = <hi>kāñjika</hi> (fermented rice water). Meulenbeld, madhavanidāna pp. 516–517 <hi>sauvīra</hi> is sour gruel made from barley and wheat. On the process see, Suśruta 1.44.35  40ab. (PV Sharma’s translation of this passage:) <quote>‘Roots of trivṛt etc., the first group (<hi>vidārigandhādi</hi>), <hi>mahat pañcamūla</hi>, <hi>mūrvā</hi> and <hi>śārṅgaṣṭā</hi>, and also of <hi>snuhī</hi>, <hi>haimavatī</hi>, <hi>triphalā</hi>, <hi>ativiṣā</hi> and <hi>vacā</hi>    these are taken and divided into two parts out of which one is decocted and the other is powdered; now, crushed barley grains are impregnated with the above decoction several times, dried and then slightly fried.

This is known as <hi>sauvīraka</hi>.’</quote> But according to some nighaṇṭus, <hi>sauvīra</hi> can also mean stibnite (an ingredient in some añjana’s and medicines): añjanaṃ yāmunaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ nādeyaṃ mecakaṃ tathā  srotojaṃ dṛkpradaṃ nīlaṃ sauvīraṃ ca suvīrajam || <textup>Rājanighaṇṭu 13.86</textup> Note also that the Yogaprakāśikā takes <hi>sauvīra</hi> with <hi>taila</hi>, perhaps to solve the problem of <hi>taila</hi> on its own (see below for more on this): <hi>sauvīrataila</hi>    oil produced in the place Suvīra (<hi>suvīradeśodbhavatailam</hi>).

On the translation of <hi>madya</hi>, see Mchugh (An Unholy Brew) 2021: 8. <hi>ājādimāṃsa</hi>: āja is required for the metre, so only ājādi makes sense, not ājāvi because there is no adjective āvi. Diwakar Acharya: prohibition of goat flesh and fish is aimed at north/east India. <hi>kulattha</hi> is a kind of pulse, translated by Dominik Wujastyk as `poor man’s pulse’ (see Roots of Ayurveda). <hi>kola</hi>: Zizyphus Jujuba (Nadkarni 1926: pp. 919  920). Also known as <hi>badara</hi>. This is how Brahmānanda takes it (<hi>kolaṃ kolyāḥ phalaṃ badaram</hi>). According to Nadkarni, the fruit of the wild variety is very acid and astringent. It is believed to purify the blood and assist digestion. The bark is astringent and a simple remedy for diarrhoea. Root is useful as a decoction in fever and delirium. kola can mean banana in some parts of India (Diwakar) There are references to <hi>kola</hi> being pungent, though this does not seem to indicate sufficiently why <hi>kola</hi> is mentioned separately as an <hi>apathya</hi> food. <hi>piṇyāka</hi>: Sharma (Ḍalhaṇa and his commentary on drugs: 1982: 69) says, ‘The remnant paste of oily seeds after pressing out the oil content is called <hi>piṇyāka</hi>.’ Diwakar says it is an oil cake that has a strong flavour. <hi>hiṅgu</hi>: Asafoetida (Nadkarni 1926: pp 360–361): `If long continued even in moderate doses, it gives rise to alliaceous eructations, acrid irritation in the throat, flatulence, diarrhoea and burning in the urine.’ <hi>laśuna</hi> = garlic (Nadkarni 1926: 45). </note>
