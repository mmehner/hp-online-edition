 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_002"> Having bowed to the glorious guru, the Lord, the yogi Svātmārāma has taught the doctrine of Haṭhayoga solely for [attaining] Rājayoga. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_003"> For those who are ignorant of Rājayoga because of confusion in the darkness of many opinions the compassionate Svātmārāma composes the Lamp on Haṭha. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_004"> In fact, Matsyendra, Gorakṣa and other [siddhas] knew the doctrine of Haṭha, and the yogi Svātmārāma knows it owing to their favour. </note>

 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_010"> Haṭha is considered a refuge for those who are burnt by the pains of transmigration. Haṭha is the foundational tortoise for the worlds of all yogas. </note>
 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_011"> The doctrine of Haṭha should be kept very secret by those yogis who are desiring success. When it is secret it becomes potent. However, when it has been revealed, it becomes impotent. </note>

 <note type="translation" target="#hp01_012"> In well ruled, righteous region, with plenty of food and free of disturbances, the Haṭhayogi should live remotely in a small hut. </note>

Here it is a literal quotation from the DYŚ, but many other Haṭhayogic texts teach a particular position of the tongue, in which it is in one or the other way turned back in the direction of the uvula, as we read explicitly in the <hi>Vivekamārtāṇḍa</hi> (REF): <hi>kapālakuhare jihvā praviṣṭā viparītagā</hi>. Brief references to this practice can become ambiguous for various reasons, and this has possibly confused Brahmānanda. One reason is that there is a, probably older, rule for meditation postures according to which the tongue rests near the teeth. One instance would be <hi>Svacchandatantra</hi>, which teaches a meditation pose called <hi>divyaṃ karaṇam</hi> (4.365f.), in which the tongue is to rest at the tip of the teeth (<hi>dantāgre jihvām ādāya</hi>). Other Tantric texts have this or similar rules, in which the tongue is supposed to rest either on the teeth or the palate,<note place="bottom">This rule is found in <hi>Iśānaśivapaddhati</hi>: <hi>tāluke jihvāṃ saṃyojya kiñcidvivṛtavaktro dantair dantān asaṃspṛśan ṛjukāyaḥ</hi>. REF</note>
 the earliest instance being perhaps <hi>Mrgendrāgama</hi> ?.18. Placing the tongue where it does not disturb the meditation seems quite appropriate for a ``normal’’ meditative practice. [Jason: There’s also a clear reference to the tip of the tongue being placed in the middle of the palate in 2.27 of the Yogapāda of the Mataṅgapārameśvaratantra (tālumadhyagatenaiva jihvāgreṇa mahāmune). In fact, in works that predate Haṭhayoga (i.e., 11th c.), the most common instruction is to put the tip of the tongue on the palate (tālu).] We might try to interpret the passage in this manner, however, once Haṭhayogic physiology is at the background, we must assume that the aim is to reach back to the uvula, to the source of the "nectar". For the background and for the crucial references see Mallinson’s note on <hi>Khecarīvidyā</hi> 1.65ab.<note place="bottom">p. 209.</note>
 Confusingly Yogic terminology has used and possibly invented new names for uvula, and among these especially the term <hi>rājadanta</hi> may give rise to confusion, since, as we have seen, the tongue might also in some Yoga systems be placed at the (front) teeth. Furthermore the details in these descriptions of the <hi>khecarīmudrā</hi> are manifold. The 10th century <hi>Mokṣopāya</hi> says that the tongue rests at the ``source of the palate’’<note place="bottom"><hi>tālumūlatalālagnajihvā</hi> MU V.55.14c.</note>
 and the commentary <hi>Saṃsārataraṇi</hi> on the parallel passage in <hi>Laghuyogavāsiṣṭha</hi> V.6.155, which reads <hi>tālumūlāntarālagnajihva </hi>, explains that this means that the tongue is to be placed in the middle of the two regions of the palate, and that this is the <hi>nabhomudrā</hi>, alias ``<hi>khecarī</hi>’’.<note place="bottom"><hi>tālumūlāntarālagnajihvamūlah. tālumūlayoh. kākudamūladeśayoh. āntare lagnam ālagnam jihvāmūlam yasyety anena nabhomudrā darśitā / yā hi khecarı̄ty ucyate.</hi></note>
 A little later in the <hi>Mokṣopāya</hi> it is made clear that one should reach the uvula, ``placed a the root of the palate’’.<note place="bottom"><hi>tālumūlagatāṃ yatnāj jihvayākramya ghaṇṭikām</hi> (V.78.24ab)</note>
 In view of this background we must conclude that the author of the <hi>Jyotsnā</hi> was probably not aware of the Yogic meaning of <hi>rājadanta</hi> and has tried his best to make sense of the passage, echoing the idea of the two roots of the palate (although his text is not talking about the palate), but then wisely refers to the instruction of the teacher for practical details, probably noticing that his literal interpretation is somewhat opaque (I omit the synonyms for clarity): <quote>Pressing both roots of the front teeth on the left and right with the tongue [ldots ] — this fixation of the tongue has to be understood from the mouth of the teacher. <hi>rājadantānāṃ daṃṣṭrāṇāṃ savyadakṣiṇabhāge sthitānāṃ mūle ubhe mūlasthāne jihvayā uttambhya ūrdhvaṃ stambhayitvā | guru mukhād avagantavyo ’yaṃ jihvā bandhaḥ |</hi></quote> [Jason: also, Brahmānanda’s comments on 3.22 indicate that he thought rājadanta refers to the front teeth. When commenting on rājadantasthajihvāyāṃ, he says kutaḥ ? yato dantānāṃ rājāno rājadantā rājadanteṣu tiṣṭhatīti rājadantasthāḥ, rājadantasthā cāsau jihvā ca tasyāṃ rājadantasthajihvāyāṃ bandhaḥ, taduparibhāgasya sambandhaḥ śastaḥ]. </note>

The teachings of the VM are attributed to Gorakṣa, not Matsyendra, although in the extended recension of it known as Gorakṣaśataka etc. the second verse includes homage to Mīna, i.e. Matsyendra. The end of pāda b is uncertain. Later witnesses including Brahmānanda have <hi>dhyāyaṃś ca</hi> but none of the early ones does. So we have to take <hi>dhyānaṃ</hi> with <hi>sannidhāya</hi>. That makes tat problematic though: what does it refer to? The two participles <hi>proccālayan</hi> and <hi>muñcan</hi> imply that the two things are happening at the same time, which is surprising but perhaps possible.

Leipzig: Harrassowitz 1910, p.,90 (A9).</note>
 but the editor saw no compelling reason not to regard it as original except through the fact that it is not transmitted in all manuscripts. What prevents further investigation of the matter is the lack of Kashmirian mss. for the <hi>Śāntiśataka</hi> and its compilatory character: one quarter of the material is identical with Bhartṛhari’s <hi>Vairāgyaśataka</hi>.

Brahmānanda: <hi>sauvīra</hi> = <hi>kāñjika</hi> (fermented rice water). Meulenbeld, madhavanidāna pp. 516–517 <hi>sauvīra</hi> is sour gruel made from barley and wheat.

It is believed to purify the blood and assist digestion. The bark is astringent and a simple remedy for diarrhoea. Root is useful as a decoction in fever and delirium. There are references to <hi>kola</hi> being pungent, though this does not seem to indicate sufficiently why <hi>kola</hi> is mentioned separately as an <hi>apathya</hi> food. <hi>piṇyāka</hi>: Sharma (Ḍalhaṇa and his commentary on drugs: 1982: 69) says, ‘The remnant paste of oily seeds after pressing out the oil content is called <hi>piṇyāka</hi>.’ <hi>hiṅgu</hi>: Asafoetida (Nadkarni 1926: pp 360–361): `If long continued even in moderate doses, it gives rise to alliaceous eructations, acrid irritation in the throat, flatulence, diarrhoea and burning in the urine.’ <hi>laśuna</hi> = garlic (Nadkarni 1926: 45). </note>

The meaning of <hi>utkaṭa</hi> is not clear. The word <hi>utkaṭā</hi> can mean pepper according to some nighaṇṭus (e.g., Rājanighaṇṭu 5.16 <hi>pārvatī śailajā tāmrā lambabījā tathotkaṭā</hi>). But <hi>utkaṭa</hi> can refer to Saccharum Sara and <hi>utkaṭā</hi> also to Laurus Cassia (cinnamon). Also, <hi>utkaṭa</hi> can be an adjective that means ‘abounding in’ at the end of a compound.
